        <h2>How to Use This Guide</h2>
        <p>
            The purpose of the guide is to empower individuals with Parkinson's Disease (PD) with the best possible knowledge to manage their condition based on the latest scientific research.
        </p>
        <p>
            Knowledge is crucial to achieving predictable success. A primary goal of any individual should be to improve one's quality of life and longevity. Quality of life depends upon health status. Health deficits lead to impaired physical and mental performance and reduced quality of life.
        </p>
        <p>
            The first step to optimizing one's health is understanding one's condition. That entails some understanding of the human organism and some understanding of any health conditions. Those who take their condition seriously and employ the best strategies to mitigate the progression of the disease will enjoy greater quality of life and longevity. Contrary to tired "listen to your doctor" mantra, this paper challenges the reader to greater self-empowerment through informed education and insight.
        </p>
        <p>
            Alpha-synuclein aggregates in the midbrain brain and damages neurons, including the autonomic nuclei, also located also throughout the body, which are responsible for autonomic functions (blood pressure, heart rate, GI system, etc). Progressive neurodegeneration is exacerbated by unilateral neurological modulation of the dopaminergic pathway (the L-Dopa / DDC inhibitors, aka "standard of care") and is more pronounced in later stages.
        </p>
        <p>
            The approach recommended herein is not the tired "listen to your doctor," but to get informed and build a team of healthcare professionals with multiple specialties with whom to collaborate on an individualized treatment plans that includes nutrition, lifestyle, supplementation, medication, monitoring, testing, and constant analysis, and revision, and an open minded approach to adjust the program to new information and personal experience. This proactive and comprehensive approach underscores the importance of self-care, self-advocacy, and ongoing education in navigating life with Parkinson's disease. You do not win with your eyes closed.
        </p>
        <p>
            A holistic approach to Parkinson's disease management empowers PD patients to control their health, optimize their quality of life and longevity, and slow the progression of the disease.

    <section id="introduction">
        <h2>
            Introduction to Parkinson's Disease (PD)
        </h2>
        <p>
            Parkinson's Disease (PD) affects various brain regions, including the substantia nigra, basal ganglia, cerebral cortex, thalamus, hippocampus, cerebellum, and other regions involved in motor control, cognition, movement and the nervous systems.
        </p>
        <p>
            The nervous system comprises the Central Nervous System (CNS), Peripheral Nervous System (PNS), and autonomic nervous system (ANS). The CNS, consisting of the brain and spinal cord, processes information and coordinates responses. The PNS connects the CNS to the body, relaying sensory input and motor output. The ANS regulates involuntary functions like heart rate and digestion.
        </p>
        <p>
            In PD, progressive neurodegeneration (PN) primarily affects the Central Nervous System (CNS), particularly dopamine-producing neurons, leading to motor symptoms like tremors and rigidity. However, dysfunction of the autonomic nervous system (ANS) becomes more noticeably pronounced in the later stages, contributing to non-motor symptoms such as GI issues, low blood pressure, and urinary dysfunction.
        </p>
        <p>
            PD-related autonomic dysfunction can exacerbate renal issues, leading to a complex interplay of factors that contribute to orthostatic hypotension in PD.
        </p>
        <h3>Alpha-synuclein</h3>
        <p>
            PD is a neurological condition resulting from pathology of alpha-synuclein (Œ±-synuclein) (Œ±-synucleinopathy). 
            <span class="call-out">Understanding the role and effects of Œ±-synuclein is key to mitigating the disease's progression.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
            Overexpression of &alpha;-synuclein leads to its aggregation and formation of &alpha;-synuclein structures, either as oligomers (peptides) or fibrils (see image). Oligomers of &alpha;-synuclein can form Lewy bodies, abnormal
            aggregations of protein that develop inside nerve cells affected by PD.
        </p>
        <p>
            <img src="img/alpha-synuclein.jpeg" alt="alpha-synuclein" class="block-image" />
        </p>
        <p>
            Alpha-synuclein is abundant primarily in the brain, especially in the neocortex, hippocampus, and substantia nigra (SN). Smaller amounts are found in the heart, muscles, and other tissues. It is transported into and out of the
            brain by the blood-brain barrier.
        </p>
        <p>
            Six mutations of &alpha;-synuclein are currently associated with familial parkinsonism. Mutant &alpha;-synuclein forms aggregates more readily than wild-type (normal) &alpha;-synuclein.
        </p>
        <p>
            Wild-type &alpha;-synuclein can be removed by lysosomes, mutant forms of &alpha;-synuclein, however, resist their degradation and inhibit that of other substrates.
        </p>
        <p>
            &alpha;-synuclein oligomers play a central role in the multi-factorial causes of Parkinson&rsquo;s disease. &alpha;-synuclein oligomers, as well as other &alpha;-synuclein variants, actively participate in disrupting
            mitochondrial function, autophagy and lysosomal degradation, membrane homeostasis, Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER) function, and synapses, and can induce inflammation.
        </p>
        
        <h4>SNCA Gene Encodes Alpha-synuclein</h4>
        <p>
            The SNCA gene encodes &alpha;-synuclein. In the brain, &alpha;-synuclein is found mainly at the tips of nerve cells (neurons) in specialized structures called presynaptic terminals.
        </p>
        <p>Mutations in the SNCA gene lead to mutant &alpha;-synuclein.</p>
        <h4>
            Autosomal Dominant Parkinson's Disease, PARK1
        </h4>
        <p>
            PARK1 is an inherited, dominant genetic trait (autosomal dominant) in PD that causes heterozygous triplication of the SNCA gene.
        </p>
        <h4>LRRK2</h4>
        <p>
            Leucine-Rich Repeat Kinase 2 (LRRK2) is an enzyme encoded by a gene of the same name (the LRRK2 gene).
        </p>
        <p>
            LRRK2 mutations are implicated in PD pathogenesis and may influence &alpha;-synuclein metabolism and neuronal function.
        </p>
        <h5>LRRK2-G2019S</h5>
        <p>
            LRRK2-G2019S is a mutant form of LRRK2 found in PD. LRRK2-G20195 causes &alpha;-synuclein accumulation in dopaminergic neurons. &alpha;-synuclein accumulation leads to all of the problems previously mentioned,
            including &alpha;-synuclein oligomers and fibrils.
        </p>
        <p>
            LRRK2 mutants in genetic PD cause shortening and simplification of the dendritic tree in vivo and in cultured neurons.
        </p>
        <p>
            LRRK2 inhibitors can improve Parkinson's disease by reducing &alpha;-synuclein.
        </p>
        <h4>PINK1</h4>
        <p>
            PTEN-induced kinase 1 (PINK1) is a kinase produced by the PINK1 gene. Mutations in the PINK1 gene are a rare cause of one form of autosomal recessive early-onset Parkinson's disease that may be more associated with
            mitophagy, a process by which damaged or dysfunctional mitochondria are removed, reducing oxidative stress and inflammation.
        </p>
        <h4>Current Therapies in Clinical Trials of Parkinson‚Äôs Disease: A 2021 Update</h4>
        <p>
            The complex pathology is partially depicted in the figure below
        </p>
        <figure>
            <img src="img/figure-1-pd.png" alt="Parkinson's Disease Pathology Diagram" class="block-image" />
            <figcaption>
                <p>
                    The pathological hallmarks of PD and the interplay of aging, environmental hazards, and genetics.
                </p>
                <p>
                    (A) The pathological hallmarks of Parkinson‚Äôs disease include dopaminergic neuronal death, &alpha;-synuclein aggregates, mitochondrial dysfunction, reactive oxygen species, apoptosis, and neuroinÔ¨Çammation.
                </p>
                <p>
                    (B) PD is a multifactorial disorder involving aging, genetics, and environmental factors, associated with dopaminergic neuronal death. Gene mutations associated with PD include DJ-1, PTEN-induced putative kinase-1 (PINK1), parkin, leucine-rich repeat kinase-2 (LRRK2), Synuclein alpha (SNAC), and ubiquitin carboxyl-terminal hydrolase-L1 (UCHL1). 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Neurotoxins (e.g., rotenone, paraquat) and gene mutations of DJ-1,  PINK1, parkin, LRRK2, and SNAC, induce mitochondria complex I inhibition, ATP depletion, reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation, mitochondria depolarization, and mitochondrial dysfunction in dopaminergic neurons to promote neuronal death in the substantia nigra of PD patients.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Overexpression of the SNCA gene can lead to the accumulation of  &alpha;-synuclein in the brain, which, if &alpha;-synuclein is of a mutant form can cause problems and contribute to the formation of Lewy bodies. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    The UCHL1 gene and the overexpression of the SNCA gene are related in that UCHL1 is involved in the degradation of &alpha;-synuclein, a protein that is overexpressed in PD. 
                <p>
                    The UCHL1 gene and the SNCA gene are both involved in PD pathogenesis.
                    UCHL1 gene mutations impair ubiquitin-proteasome systems and further induce autophagy lysosomal pathway dysfunction, contributing to Lewy body formation in dopaminergic neurons.

        <p>The authors miscall the &alpha;-synuclein gene, SNCA, "SNAC". Most of what they categorize as genetic is epigenetic. That is, attributable to a combination of genetic <em>and</em> environmental factors.</p>
        <p>
            Lewy bodies are comprised of &alpha;-synuclein fibrils, the manifestation of which can be partly affected by environmental factors. Lewy bodies appear in the ‚ÄúGenetic factors" group below &alpha;-synuclein.
        </p>
        <p>
            &alpha;-synuclein increase is not solely attributable to genetics but to a variety of epigenetic factors that can be affected.
        </p>
        <p>
            Epigenetic factors can influence mutations in LRRK2 (LRRK2-G2019S) and cause encoding mutations in LRRK2 and SNCA genes that affect the production and pathogenicity of mutant &alpha;-synuclein.
        </p>
        <p>
            Vitamin B12, for example, is an external factor that prevents LRRK2-G2019S-potentiated &alpha;-synuclein accumulation in dopaminergic neurons.

        </p>
        <p>
            Salivary &alpha;-synuclein was tested. Total &alpha;-synuclein was lower, but &alpha;-synuclein oligomers were higher in PD than in healthy subjects. (See:
            <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30796010/">Salivary alpha-synuclein in the diagnosis of Parkinson's disease and Progressive Supranuclear Palsy</a>)

        <p>
            Genetic testing can help identify the type of PD. All genes associated with PD contribute to disease in the same way. LRRK2 and GBA genes can be tested on 23andme.

        </p>
        <p>
            Approach strategies can be grouped into symptomatic treatment and disease progression treatment, with some overlap.

        <section id="symptomatic">
            <h4>Symptomatic Treatment</h4>
            <h5>Gold Standard: Dopamine Agonism</h5>
            <p class="call-out">
                The gold standard for managing PD is symptomatic management via dopamine agonism. Unfortunately, that leads to other neurological imbalances, causes other nutrient deficiencies, and leads to PN.
            </p>
            <h5>Increasing Dopamine Levels</h5>
            <ul>

            </ul>
            <p>
                Some doctors may attempt to enhance dopamine function by suppressing the cholinergic system using anticholinergics, but this approach leads to adverse effects.
            </p>        
        </section>
        <section id="disease-progression">
            <h4>Disease-Progression Approach</h4>
            <p>
                Doctors tend to discount the idea of slowing the progression of the disease. Some will off-handedly discount supplements and nutrition into "complementary" care without examination. Many of these same doctors once prescribed anticholinergics. (If your doctor is one of those, get a new doctor.)
            </p>

            <h5>The Role of Nutrition</h5>
            <p>
                Nutritional deficiencies can exacerbate symptoms in individuals with Parkinson's disease (PD) and may sometimes be mistaken for progressive neurodegeneration. This misinterpretation can lead to inappropriate management strategies if the underlying nutritional issues are not addressed.
            </p>
            <p>
                Furthermore, certain nutrient deficiencies can trigger cascading effects, exacerbating PD symptoms or hasten the decline of the condition. For example, deficiencies in vitamins B12, folate, and vitamin D have been implicated in PD and can affect neurological function and overall health. Inadequate intake of essential nutrients can also impair mitochondrial function, increase oxidative stress, and compromise neurotransmitter synthesis and signaling, all of which are implicated in PD pathophysiology.
            </p>
            <p>
                Additionally, levodopa/carbidopa therapy can reduce vitamin B6 levels, which is essential for the synthesis of neurotransmitters.
            </p>
            <p>
                It's crucial to build a comprehensive plan that strikes a balance between supplementation, nutrition, lifestyle, and regular monitoring to slow disease progression.
            </p>
            <p>
                Don't just "talk to your doctor", collaborate with a team of healthcare professionals with multiple specialties to create individualized treatment plans that include nutrition, lifestyle, supplementation, and medication. Regularly test and monitor status with symptoms and biochemical markers to assess the effectiveness of interventions and make adjustments as needed.
            </p>

                <dfn>Antifibrillogenics</dfn> mitigate formation of Œ±-synuclein fibrils. Anti-aggregants aim to prevent the accumulation of fibrils and other misfolded proteins into lewy bodies. By preventing the formation of Œ±-synuclein fibrils and aggregates, these compounds address the underlying pathology of Parkinson's disease at a more fundamental level, potentially offering therapeutic benefits in managing the condition.

                Preventing fibril aggregation (<dfn>anti-aggregant</dfn>): These treatments focus on inhibiting the aggregation of Œ±-synuclein fibrils into Lewy bodies, potentially slowing the spread of pathology and neurodegeneration.
            </p>
            <p>
                It is necessary to work with doctors who focus on what works. Focus on the facts and evidence, consider risk/reward, and work on total health. Avoid doctors who won't look at the evidence you present them.
            </p>
            <h4>What Do Doctors Miss?</h4>
            <p>
                Doctors typically prioritize symptoms over addressing the underlying causes. Specifically, they tend to focus on the dopamine pathway with medications like levodopa/carbidopa, to enhance dopamine levels in the brain, and COMT inhibitors, to inhibit its breakdown by catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT).
            </p>
            <p>
                Approaches to mitigating the underlying cause can extend longevity, improve quality of life, and reduce the dependence on medication which is not without side effects. Address these key areas for a more comprehensive approach to managing PD:

                Many approaches overlap more than one problem area and have synergistic benefits. For example, 5-HTP is converted into serotonin in the brain. It inhibits the release of glutamate, mitigates oxidation modulates dopamine
                release, improves mitochondrial function, and improves sleep, which improves overall health, leading to a better sense of well-being and better exercise capacity and recovery.
            </p>
            <p>
                Effective treatment must approach PD from multiple angles. This requires understanding its pathology. The review <cite>"Current Therapies in Clinical Trials of Parkinson‚Äôs Disease: A 2021 Update"</cite>, provides a fair overview
                of PD.

            <h4>Holistic Approach</h4>
            <p>
                The best possible individual results can be obtained with a holistic approach that minimizes dopaminergic modulation. This approach addresses the complexity of Parkinson's disease, including both motor and non-motor symptoms. By considering the interconnectedness of various physiological systems, it offers more comprehensive and personalized care.

                Peptide therapy, by practitioner in-home visits, can be used (SS-31, AICAR, Epitalon, Pinealon).
            </p -->
            
            <p>
                The holistic approach is a multifaceted, evidence-based strategy that involves thinking and problem-solving skills. Its primary objective is maximizing health and longevity while navigating the challenges of PD. 
            
            <p>         
                It is also a self-directed problem-solving approach that involves breaking down the complexity of PD and human health in general into fundamental parts, stripping away assumptions, and using logic, reason, and evidence to tackle the complexity of PD. Putting reason over faith means it is not for everyone.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The holistic approach is for patients, providers, and caretakers open to embracing new ideas, challenging conventional wisdom, and actively participating in the decision-making process to maximize patient health. 
            </p>

            <p>
                The holistic approach is <em>not</em> "complementary" or "alternative" therapy. In contrast, it is a multifaceted, evidence-based strategy for managing Parkinson's disease that focuses on health-maximization through a multitude of approaches mentioned throughout this document to address the underlying pathology. So, although this approach is not for everyone, it does however, lead to predictably favorable outcomes compared to the disease-progression approach for several reasons outlined above and elaborated on herein. Despite these benefits, many may still prefer the disease-progression approach. 
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The downsides of this approach include the upfront cost of time, effort, and financial investment. 
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Additionally, this approach involves building a care team of providers open to identifying root causes and developing innovative solutions. This proactive approach challenges conventional methods and focuses on evidence, cause, and effect. Diverging from the norm, as such, can pose challenges in building a healthcare team. Ultimately, it's up to the reader to weigh the options and forge their own journey in managing Parkinson's disease. 
            </p>
            
            <p>
                What specific benefits does it offer? By applying first-principles thinking, individuals can develop a deeper understanding of complex problems, challenge assumptions, and create innovative solutions to maximize health and longevity.

            <p>
                While the holistic approach demands more time, effort, and initial investment, it forces a crucial question: confront the complexity of Parkinson's disease or hope for the best? This approach challenges conventional methods, requiring individuals to question assumptions and embrace change. While not an easy path, evidence-based strategies offer potential benefits in symptom management and overall well-being. For those seeking a comprehensive approach to managing Parkinson's disease, the holistic approach presents a clear choice: proactive engagement or supplication to limited solutions from your healthcare system's neurologist.

            <p>
                Levodopa/Carbidopa are dopamine agonists. COMT inhibitors prevent the breakdown of dopamine. Both classes of drugs exhibit dopaminergic side effects.
            </p>
            
			<section>
				<h4>Dopamine Replacement Therapy ‚Äî Overview</h4>
			
				<p>
					Dopamine replacement therapy (DRT) for PD commonly includes levodopa/carbidopa (LD/DCC) and MAO-B inhibitors. 
				</p>
				<p>
					Replenishing dopamine levels in the brain helps alleviate motor symptoms such as tremors, rigidity, and bradykinesia (slowness, freezing), improving patients' quality of life. However, dopamine replacement therapy has other effects, good and bad.
				</p>
			
				<h4>Impact of Dopamine Agonists</h4>

				<h5>Fibrillization</h5>
				<p>
					Dopamine agonists inhibit fibrillization by reacting with the Œ±-synuclein. This is an advantage, as fibrils contribute to cellular damage, senescent cells, and neurodegeneration. However, it does so by an oxidative process that, in excess, also contributes to cellular damage and neurodegeneration. 
				</p>

				<p>
					Alpha-synuclein fibrillization inhibition must be balanced to both minimize and mitigate oxidative stress, and this requires a multi-faceted approach. 
				</p>
			
				<h5>Neurochemical and Vitamin Imbalances</h5>
				<p>
					Dopamine agonists also deplete active vitamin B6 levels in the body. They do this by irreversibly binding to and permanently deactivating pyridoxal 5‚Äô-phosphate (P5P), the active form of vitamin B6. This leads to various side effects and exacerbates the progression of the disease, as B6 is essential for dopamine synthesis and is involved in other metabolic pathways.
				</p>

				<h5>Progressive Neurodegeneration</h5>
				<p>
					Dopamine is but one of many neurochemical systems in the midbrain. Focusing solely on the dopaminergic system without considering other neurotransmitter systems leads to inadequate symptom management, exacerbation of non-motor symptoms, and progressive neurodegeneration (PN).
				</p>
						
				<h4>Dopamine Replacement Therapy ‚Äî Summary</h4>
				<p>
					Therefore, while dopamine replacement is beneficial, its use can be minimized to the least effective dose with a multi-faceted approach that addresses neuroprotection, neurorestoration, antioxidation, and mitochondrial health.

                <p>
                    Pregnenolone is a neurosteroid and precursor to various hormones, including cortisol, DHEA, and progesterone. Its potential role in countering Levodopa-induced dyskinesias (LIDs) without compromising L-DOPA's motor benefits is intriguing.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Pregnenolone is available as a dietary supplement and typically safe in doses ranging from 10 to 50 mg per day.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Pregnenolone is believed to penetrate the BBB easily due to its lipophilic nature. Once in the brain, pregnenolone can be converted into other neurosteroids, such as allopregnanolone, which have various effects on neuronal function and behavior.

                <p>
                    Dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) is a hormone produced by the adrenal glands, the ovaries, and the brain. It is a precursor to both estrogen and testosterone and is converted into estrogen and testosterone in peripheral tissues.
                </p>
                <p>
                    DHEA is also involved in the regulation of sleep, memory, and cholesterol levels
                </p>
                <p>
                    DHEA has been shown to have neuroprotective effects, which may help protect against the progression of PD.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A study found that DHEA administration alone improved the mean parkinsonian score in moderately and severely impaired MPTP monkeys, a model of Parkinson‚Äôs disease.

                <p>
                    Several clinical studies have investigated pregnenolone as a treatment for Parkinson‚Äôs disease. One study found that pregnenolone dose-dependently countered L-DOPA-induced dyskinesias (LIDs) without affecting L-DOPA-induced motor improvements. 
                </p>
                <p>Like pregnenolone, DHEA is lipid-soluble, which allows it to cross the BBB relatively easily, and is available as a dietary supplement. Recommended dosage is 100mg ED.

            <h3>Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS)</h3>
            <p>
                Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS) uses electrodes implanted in the brain to deliver electrical impulses to the globus pallidus internus (GPi). This helps to regulate brain activity.
            </p>
            <p>
                DBS of the (GPi) primarily targets the GABAergic output neurons of the basal ganglia, influencing motor output and reducing motor symptoms in PD. However, the therapeutic effects of GPi stimulation in PD extend beyond
                modulating GABAergic transmission within the basal ganglia circuitry and can indirectly impact cortical glutamatergic input to the basal ganglia.
            </p>
            <p>
                While GPi stimulation primarily targets the GABAergic output of the basal ganglia, the dopaminergic system remains crucial in PD pathology and treatment. Dopamine depletion in the basal ganglia is a hallmark feature of
                PD and leads to motor symptoms such as bradykinesia, tremors, and rigidity, and DBS helps treat these problems.
            </p>
            <p>
                Other neurotransmitter systems affected by DBS include the serotonergic, cholinergic, noradrenergic, and glutamatergic systems. Due to the delicate balance between all these systems stimulation of the entire GPi can more
                easily achieve a positive, balanced effect, compared to medication and supplementation with l-dopa/carbidopa and supplements like 5-HTP and GABA.
            </p>
            <p>
                This normalizes basal ganglion activity resulting in reduced excitotoxicity, better neuronal function, and greater cell longevity.
            </p>
            <p>
                Medication alone leads to PN. DBS reduces the need for medication, thus mitigating PN. Supplementation further reduces the need for medication, and thus PN. A team of specialists to craft a program with DBS, medication,
                and supplementation may offer the best possible outcome with the least PN and greater longevity.
            </p>
            <p>
                Crafting a personalized treatment program that incorporates DBS, medication, and supplementation requires the expertise of a multidisciplinary team of specialists, including neurologists, movement disorder specialists,
                neurosurgeons, pharmacists, dietitians, and other healthcare professionals. This team can collaborate to tailor treatment to the individual patient's needs, optimize therapy, and minimize PN.

                Near-infrared (NIR) Light (700-1100 nm) penetrates deeper into tissues, making it a better choice for targeting deeper affected brain regions.
            </p>

            <p>
                Red light can be effective, too, but the longer duration and stronger intensity required for efficacy may overstimulate skin. If you have a device that allows for a blend of NIR and red frequencies, use a lower intensity
                for the red frequencies to glean their dermal benefits while getting more intense NIR for the deep regions of the brain.
            </p>
            
            <h4>Oxidative Stress and Inflammation</h4>
            
            <p>
                PBM has anti-inflammatory effects, which can help mitigate the inflammatory response associated with ischemic injury, reducing tissue damage and promoting healing.
            </p>
            
            <h4>Ischemia and Blood Flow</h4>
            <p>
                PBM has been shown to increase local blood flow and oxygenation in ischemic     tissues, which can help alleviate hypoxia (low oxygen levels) and promote tissue recovery.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Ischemia can affect the delivery of therapeutic agents to the desired target in the midbrain. During ischemic events, blood flow to affected brain regions can be significantly compromised, limiting the delivery of oxygen and nutrients, and therapeutic compounds like melatonin.
            </p>
                
            <p>
                The timing of PBM, in conjunction with the administration of substances like melatonin, can play a role in potentially mitigating the effects of ischemic inhibition on nutrient delivery to the midbrain.
            </p>

            <p>
                Near-infrared (NIR) light has a deeper penetration depth than red light, allowing it to reach deeper tissues and organs, including the brain, without overstimulating the skin.

Antifibrillogenic and Anti-aggregant: Compounds in cacao may help prevent the formation and aggregation of Œ±-synuclein fibrils, which are characteristic of PD pathology.

Neuroprotective and Antioxidant: Cacao's flavonoids possess antioxidant properties, potentially protecting neuronal structures from oxidative stress, which is implicated in PD progression.

Anti-inflammatory: Some components of cacao may have anti-inflammatory effects, which could help reduce neuroinflammation associated with PD.

Neurorestorative: By promoting mitochondrial health and possibly enhancing cellular processes like mitophagy, cacao might facilitate the recovery and regeneration of neural tissue in PD.

Dopaminergic side-effects: While cacao itself is not a direct treatment for PD symptoms, its potential neuroprotective and antioxidant properties could help mitigate some of the side effects associated with dopaminergic treatments used in PD management.

Sleep: Cacao contains compounds like theobromine, which may have stimulant effects, but individual responses to cacao consumption can vary regarding its impact on sleep. Moderate consumption may not significantly affect sleep patterns for most individuals.

Senolytic: While cacao has not been directly studied as a senolytic agent, its antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties may indirectly contribute to cellular health and potentially impact senescent cells.

                    <h5>Introduction to Turmeric and Curcuminoids</h5>
                    <p>
                        Turmeric is a rhizome of the Curcuma longa plant.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Curcumin is the most well-known and studied curcuminoind found in turmeric. Other curcuminoids contribute to turmeric's health benefits. Herein, I'll refer to the two interchangeably.
                    <p>
                
                    <h5>How Turmeric Helps PD</h5>
                    <p>
                        Several studies in different experimental models of PD strongly support the use of curcumin in PD. Specifically, with neuroprotection, neurogenesis, antifibrillogenic, and anti-aggregation. These actions contribute to a healthier brain, improved cognitive function, and a staving off of progressive neurodegeneration (PN).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Curcumin crosses the blood-brain barrier to reach deep brain structures, including the midbrain, where it directly exerts its beneficial effects. 
                    </p>

					<h5>Taking Turmeric</h5>

					<p>
						Turmeric is very safe at 1-3g daily. Excessively high doses strain the kidneys.
					</p>

                    <h5>Challenges with Curcumin Absorption</h5>
                    <p>
                        Although curcumin pills are convenient, orally-ingested curcumin is poorly absorbed.
                    </p>
                
                    <h5>Self-Emulsifying Drug Delivery Systems SEDDS</h5>
                    <p> 
                        Self-Emulsifying Drug Delivery Systems (SEDDS) are lipid-based formulations that create an emulsion to improve the oral bioavailability of lipophilic substances, like curcumin.
                    </p>
                
                    <h5>Enhancing Absorption with Food</h5>
                    <p>                         
                        Curcuminoids, being fat-soluble polyphenols, integrate into curries, with vegetables and coconut oil, offering both flavor and health benefits. This formulation with food facilitates better absorption. Additionally, turmeric can be blended into warm milk with other spices, as <dfn>"golden milk"</dfn>.

                <p>
                    EGCG (epigallocatechin gallate), a component in Green Tea, inhibits the ability of preformed oligomers, such as oligomers of &alpha;-synuclein, to permeabilize vesicles and induce cytotoxicity in rat brain cells.

                    </em>
                    Green tea contains moderate levels of fluoride, a neurotoxin. Matcha, a Japanese powdered green tea, which contains high levels of EGCG also, unfortunately, has slightly high levels of oxalates. Oxalates contribute to
                    inflammation and damage kidneys. Supplemental ECCG can provide the desired dose without the fluoride oxalate concentrations found in green tea.

                    Most research on ALA uses both s- and r- isoforms. The s- form inhibits the absorption of the r- isomer, and the r- isomer has better bioavailability. Thus, when using the r- form, a smaller dose can be more effective.

                <p>
                    ALCAR protects dopaminergic neurons by abrogating neuroinflammation, apoptosis, astrogliosis, and oxidative stress. For PD, ALCAR protects cells against the accumulation of alpha-synuclein.

                <h4>GABA, 5-HTP, and Melatonin</h4>
                <p>
                    GABA, 5-HTP, and melatonin can help PD patients through multiple neurological pathways. They're grouped because they all promote sleep and should all be taken at night.
                </p>
                <h5>Dopaminergic, Serotonergic, and GABAergic Systems</h5>
                <p>
                    The dopaminergic, serotonergic, and GABAergic systems are three important and interdependent neurotransmitter systems in the brain that play critical roles in regulating various physiological and psychological processes. All are impacted by PD and all are interrelated. Doctors typically only address the dopaminergic system, leading to imbalances in the other systems, nutrient deficiencies, and progressive neurodegeneration (PN).
                </p>
                <p>
                    Addressing only the dopaminergic system without considering the broader neurochemical landscape results in inadequate management of PD symptoms, exacerbates non-motor symptoms, and leads treatment-related complications. Furthermore, medications used to manage PD symptoms, such as levodopa, modulate only the dopaminergic system. This lopsided approach impacts other neurotransmitter systems and can contribute to nutrient deficiencies or imbalances.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It is crucial to take a comprehensive approach to PD management that considers the interplay between neurotransmitter systems and addresses both motor and non-motor symptoms. This may involve a combination of pharmacological interventions, lifestyle modifications, and nutritional support to optimize patient outcomes and quality of life while minimizing potential side effects and complications associated with treatment.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A comprehensive approach to PD must consider not only the direct effects of medications but also their broader implications for nutritional status and metabolic function.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Unfortunately, most doctors typically address the dopaminergic system.
                </p>

                <p>
                    GABA and 5-HTP modulate the GABAergic and serotonergic pathways, respectively. It's crucial to have everyone on your medical team on board with this, to avoid causing depletion of any one nutrient, as depletion can exacerbates PN.

                    <p>
                        GABA (gamma-aminobutyric acid) is an inhibitory neurotransmitter that plays a crucial role in regulating the activity of dopaminergic neurons in the brain.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        GABA supplementation has positive effects on GABAergic neurons.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In Parkinson‚Äôs disease, the loss of GABAergic neurons in the substantia nigra, a region responsible for motor control, is thought to contribute to the development of motor symptoms.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Dyskinesia is a common side effect of long-term treatment with levodopa in Parkinson‚Äôs disease.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        GABA supplementation and GABAergic neurons in the substantia nigra are important for the regulation of dopamine release and the modulation of movement. GABA supplementation at 1000mg ED is safe and is likely to
                        ameliorate these side effects.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Non-pharmacological approaches such as physical therapy and deep brain stimulation (DBS) surgery targeting GABAergic circuits may also be considered for managing motor complications.

                    <p>
                        PD affects not only the dopaminergic system but also other neurotransmitter systems, including the serotonergic system. It does this by affecting causing a gradual and nonlinear degeneration of serotonergic
                        terminals, which is associated with the development of non-motor symptoms and complications. Insufficient serotonin production or function has been linked to GI dysfunction, a common problem in PD, and may be related
                        to visual hallucinations in some patients.

                    <p>
                        L-dopa/Carbidopa therapy interferes with nutrient metabolism. For example, this drug combination can reduce vitamin B6 levels, which is essential for the synthesis of other neurotransmitters.

                        The complex and interdependent nature of metabolic pathways involving neurotransmitters and essential nutrients such as dopamine, norepinephrine, epinephrine, glutathione, S-adenosylmethionine (SAMe), methionine,
                        cysteine, tryptophan, serotonin, and vitamin B6. These compounds play crucial roles in neurological function, oxidative stress regulation, mood regulation, and overall health.

                    <p>
                        It's crucial to strike a balance with diet, supplementation, and regular monitoring to slow disease progression.

                        5-HTP is converted into serotonin in the brain. It inhibits the release of glutamate, mitigates oxidation, and modulates dopamine release.

                    <p>
                        The effects of PD on the serotonergic system are vastly understated. Several studies have shown serotonergic dysfunction in Parkinson's disease is associated with the development of motor and non-motor symptoms and
                        complications.

                        Neuroprotection: 5-HTP has been shown to have neuroprotective effects in various animal models of neurodegenerative diseases, including Parkinson‚Äôs disease. It may help reduce oxidative stress, inflammation, and
                        mitochondrial dysfunction, which are thought to contribute to Parkinson‚Äôs disease pathogenesis.

                        Melatonin protects neurons, especially against oxidative stress, a problem exacerbated by PD, leading to progressive neurodegeneration (PN). 
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Melatonin's role in protecting neurons against oxidative stress is particularly significant in neurodegenerative diseases like PD. By scavenging free radicals and enhancing the activity of antioxidative enzymes, such as superoxide dismutase, glutathione peroxidase, and glutathione reductase, melatonin slows the progression of neurodegeneration.
                    </p>
                
                    <p>
                        Melatonin receptors MT1 and MT2 in the substantia nigra are reduced in PD patients. Supplementing melatonin helps amend this deficit.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Melatonin's neuroprotective effects, bolstered by its anti-inflammatory effects, may contribute to the preservation of MT1 and MT1 receptors.
                    </p>
                                
                    <p>
                        Melatonin's anti-inflammatory properties may further contribute to its neuroprotective effects in PD, as inflammation is also implicated in the pathogenesis of the disease.

                        Ischemia, a condition where blood flow and oxygen supply are restricted or reduced to a part of the body, has been linked to Parkinson‚Äôs disease (PD). In PD, ischemia can occur in various parts of the brain, including the substantia nigra, which is responsible for producing dopamine, a neurotransmitter essential for motor function.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Ischemia can impair mitochondrial function, leading to energy depletion and cell death.

                    Mitochondrial Quinones (PQQ, CoQ10, Menaquinone (MK-4 and MK7 (k2))

                <p>
                    Quinones are a class of compounds that play a crucial role in maintaining mitochondrial function and overall cellular health. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    PQQ, CoQ10, and Menaquinone (MK-4 and MK7 (k2)) are three quinones that have been studied for their potential benefits on mitochondrial function.
                </p>
                <p>
                    All three promote mitochondrial function by supporting biogenesis, energy production, and reducing oxidative stress. Combined supplementation may have synergistic effects on mitochondrial function, leading to improved overall cellular health, reduced fatigue, and better overall health.

                        PQQ Pyrroloquinoline Quinone (PQQ)
                    </h4>
                    <p>
                        PQQ is a naturally occurring coenzyme manufactured by bacteria, found in plants in tiny amounts, and utilized by mammalian cells as an important nutritional growth factor. PQQ is not produced endogenously in humans.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        PQQ has multiple beneficial effects, including preventing the formation of &alpha;-synuclein fibrils, strengthening mitochondria, promoting mitochondrial biogenesis in brain cells, improving cognitive deficits from oxidative damage, inhibiting senescence, and enhancing memory, attention, cognition, and learning. It also increases blood flow to the cerebral cortex, protects against cell damage from pesticides, prevents neurodegeneration due to oxidative stress, and reduces LDL cholesterol to inhibit osteoporosis.
                    </p>
                    <h5>
                        Dosage:
                    </h5>
                    <p>
                        100-150mg per day. PQQ is very safe. In 2017, The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) Panel on Dietetic Products determined a no‚Äêobserved‚Äêadverse‚Äêeffect‚Äêlevel (NOAEL) of 100 mg/kg bw per day, for a 90-day repeated oral dose toxicity study with
                        BioPQQ&trade;. At 100 mg/kg bw, a 50kg woman would be expected to observe no side effects up to 5 grams per day of PQQ.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Given the vast multitude of benefits that occur on the cellular level, and especially by reducing alpha-synuclein fibrils relevant to PD sufferers, and the incredibly high safety threshold, a recommended dose of PQQ is 100-200mg per day. There are no known contraindications.

                    <p>
                        In a study published in The Lancet, a patient with advanced Multiple System Atrophy (MSA) showed restored brain oxygen consumption after taking 1200 mg of oral ubiquinol. This finding suggests a potential benefit of ubiquinol supplementation in MSA patients, possibly related to its role in supporting mitochondrial function.

                    Geranylgeraniol (GG)
                </h4>
                <p>
                    Geranylgeraniol (GG) is synthesized endogenously in the human body via the mevalonate pathway, which is the same biochemical pathway by which cholesterol, heme A, dolichol, and ubiquinone (CoQ10) are synthesized. GG is an essential building block for the production of CoQ10, vitamin K2, and testosterone, as well as for protein synthesis and modification. Geranylgeraniol has been linked to Parkinson‚Äôs disease in several ways.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Dolichols are the major lipid component (14% by mass) of human substantia nigra. Alterations in their synthesis and composition may contribute to the pathophysiology of Parkinson‚Äôs disease.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Further studies are needed to fully understand the relationship between GG, dolichol, and Parkinson‚Äôs disease, but the available evidence suggests that GG may play a critical role in maintaining the health of dopamine-producing neurons and potentially slowing disease progression.
                </p>
                <p>
                    GG is involved in the synthesis of dopamine, a neurotransmitter that is depleted in Parkinson‚Äôs disease.
                </p>
                <p>
                    GG synthesis decreases with age. GG inhibits the activity of MAO-B and reduces oxidative stress in dopamine-producing neurons, which may help to slow the progression of Parkinson‚Äôs disease.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Supplementing geranyl geraniol is considered very safe because the body has a natural regulatory mechanism to control its levels. The body can regulate the production of geranyl geraniol by adjusting the activity of enzymes involved in the mevalonate pathway. This ensures that the levels of geranyl geraniol in the body remain within a healthy range, reducing the risk of adverse effects.

                    Nattokinase is a proteolytic and fibrinolytic enzyme Nattokinase that reduces inflammation.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Nattokinase has been shown to degrade amyloid fibrils in mice, which may help to slow down the progression of Parkinson‚Äôs disease.

                <p>
                    Nattokinase has been shown to promote the non-amyloidogenic processing of AŒ≤, which may help to reduce the accumulation of amyloid plaques in the brain.

                <p>
                    DHA is neuroprotective and prevents ROS production in dopaminergic neurons via enhancement of glutathione homeostasis. With DHA, higher doses are not only safe, they are more effective in lipid oxidation. 2000mg DHA per

                <p>
                    Uridine is a type of nucleoside, a fundamental component of nucleic acids. Nucleic acids are the building blocks of life, and they play a crucial role in the storage and transmission of genetic information.
                </p>
                <h5>How it Works</h5>
                <p>
                    Uridine increases CDP choline. As explained under the section DHA &amp; Uridine, Uridine restores unilateral dopaminergic neurotransmission caused by oxidopamine lesions.
                </p>
                <p>
                    UMP is a precursor to the synthesis of brain phospholipids, which are important for cell membrane structure and function. It has been shown to support memory, learning, and overall cognitive function.
                </p>

                <p>
                    <strong>‚ùå CAUTION </strong>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Contrary to dying myth, acetylcholine does not cause the tremors of PD. The drugs given to reduce CDP choline in PD, such as Trihexyphenidyl and Benztropine, not only don't help PD, they have serious side effects!
                    They cause confusion, memory issues, hallucinations, dry mouth, blurry vision, and urinary retention problems.
                </p>
                <p><em>Increasing</em> choline by 1,200 mg of supplemental citicoline improved tremors in PD and allowed patients to halve their L-dopa + dopa decarboxylase inhibitor dose. Uridine increases CDP.</p>
                <p>
                    It's important to have a healthcare provider that understands and accounts for this as part of a holistic plan.

                    Citicoline (CDP Choline)
                </h4>
                <p>
                    As mentioned in the uridine discussion, citicoline supplementation halves L-Dopa / dopa decarboxylase dosage. Citicoline is neuroprotective.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In patients with chronic cerebral ischemia, citicoline improves scores in cognitive rating scales, while in patients with Alzheimer's senile dementia, it stops the course of the disease, and neuroendocrine,
                    neuroimmunomodulatory, and neurophysiological benefits have been reported. Citicoline has also been shown to be effective in PD, drug addictions, and alcoholism, as well as in amblyopia and glaucoma. No
                    serious side effects have occurred in any series of patients treated with citicoline, which attests to the safety of treatment with citicoline.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Citicoline reduces glutamate excitotoxicity and oxidative stress, increases neurotrophin levels, enhances neurotransmitter release (such as norepinephrine and dopamine), promotes mitochondrial function, and modulates
                    insulin signaling. In addition, citicoline prevents ischemia-induced tissue accumulation of free fatty acids and reduces infarct volume and brain edema, thus resulting in an antiapoptotic effect that is related to the 
                    mitochondrial-dependent cell death mechanism.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As mentioned in this document, CDP is involved in the synthesis of phosphatidylcholine, a major component of cell membranes, and also serves as a precursor to both choline and uridine in the brain.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Uridine, a nucleotide base, can convert to CDP-choline (Citicoline) and back again. This conversion process is a natural metabolic pathway in the body.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Citicoline improves axonal transport deficits and supports axon regeneration. Axon regeneration is limited in adults, partly due to the reduced growth potential of mature neurons.
                </p>
                <h5>Uridine and CDP Choline</h5>
                <p>
                    The combination of uridine and CDP choline has been shown to have numerous benefits for brain health and cognitive function, including:
                </p>
                <p>
                    Improved memory and learning: Uridine and CDP choline have been shown to enhance memory and learning by increasing the production of acetylcholine, a neurotransmitter involved in memory formation.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Neuroprotection: The combination of uridine and CDP choline has been shown to have neuroprotective effects, potentially helping to protect against neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer‚Äôs and Parkinson‚Äôs.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Improved cognitive function: Uridine and CDP choline have been shown to improve cognitive function, including attention, focus, and processing speed.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Because Uridine increases CDP levels, it is necessary to strike a balance between supplemental Uridine and CDP.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Striking a balance between supplemental uridine and CDP choline is especially important for individuals taking carbidopa/levodopa.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Since uridine is a precursor to CDP choline, increasing uridine levels can potentially affect the balance of these two compounds in the body.
                </p>
                UMP and CDP choline may have slightly different mechanisms of action and potential benefits. Some research suggests that CDP-choline may have more direct effects on acetylcholine levels in the brain, while UMP may have more
                pronounced effects on dopamine levels.
                <p>
                    Normally, the body tightly regulates these pathways, so and excessive supplementation may not necessarily lead to imbalances.

                    However, the effects of these supplements vary on individual basis, so the dose will need to be custom-tailored.

                <h5>How B-12 helps Parkinson's Disease</h5>
                <p>
                    A study published in Cell Research, "Vitamin B12 modulates Parkinson‚Äôs disease LRRK2 kinase activity through allosteric regulation and confers neuroprotection" found that B-12 has multiple mechanisms related to LRRK2
                    expressions that protect dopaminergic neurons.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Vitamin B12 inhibits LRRK2 kinase activity. This protects dopaminergic neurons from toxicity induced by LRRK2 and its mutant form, LRRK2-G2019S. The effect was shown to deficits in dopamine transmission in LRRK2-PD mouse
                    models.

                <p>
                    Supplementation with nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN), niacin, and nicotinamide riboside (NR) increases cellular levels of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+).
                </p>
                <h5>Nicotinamide Adenine Dinucleotide (NAD+)</h5>
                <p>
                    NAD+ is a coenzyme involved in various cellular processes, including energy metabolism, DNA repair, and cell signaling.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Aging is accompanied by a gradual decline in tissue and cellular NAD+ levels. This decline is linked causally to numerous age-associated diseases, including cognitive decline, cancer, metabolic disease, sarcopenia, and
                    frailty. Many of these age-associated diseases can be slowed down and even reversed by restoring NAD+ levels.
                </p>
                <p>
                    NAD+ is essential for mitochondrial function and mitigating oxidative stress response pathways. As mentioned, mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress play significant roles in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease. Declining NAD+ levels contribute to reduced mitochondrial function and impaired cellular energy metabolism in neurons, making them more susceptible to oxidative damage and degeneration. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    NAD+ is also involved in cellular signaling pathways that regulate neuronal survival and inflammation. Dysregulation of these pathways due to NAD+ depletion can exacerbate neuroinflammation and neuronal death in PD.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Strengthening mitochondrial function and count in neuronal cells prevents loss of Mitochondrial Sirtuin 3 (SIRT3) and preserves their function.
                </p>
                <p>
                    NAD+ modulation may influence dopaminergic neurotransmission and synaptic plasticity, potentially alleviating motor symptoms and improving quality of life in PD patients.
                </p>
                <h5>NAD Precursor Synergy</h5>
                <p>
                    All three precursors to NAD+ and their supplementation have been shown to increase NAD+ levels in cells to support mitochondrial function, energy metabolism, and DNA repair. NMN seems to be the safest, best-tolerated,
                    and, because it closer in the pathway to NAD+ production, most effective and the production of NAD+.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Niacin also increases NAD+ levels through a longer metabolic pathway. While niacin has been studied for its potential health benefits, including cardiovascular health, its effectiveness in boosting NAD+ levels compared
                    to NMN and NR may be lower.
                </p>
                <section id="nmn">
                    <h5>NMN</h5>
                    <p>
                        NMN is a precursor to NAD+. NAD+ levels decline with age and in certain disease states, including Parkinson's disease (PD). A typical dose of NMN is about 1g per day. It's considered safe and rodent models have used
                        much higher doses.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        NAD+ precursors like NMN, NR, and Niacin may help with Energy metabolism, neuroprotection, mitochondrial function, and DNA repair.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        NMN supplementation can help replenish NAD+ levels to support mitochondrial function and energy production, including in neurons, potentially mitigating the energy deficits observed in PD.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Neuroprotection: NAD+ plays a role in cellular stress response pathways and may have neuroprotective effects. By enhancing NAD+ levels, NMN supplementation could help protect neurons from oxidative stress,
                        inflammation, and other pathological processes associated with PD.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Mitochondrial function: Dysfunction of mitochondria, the cellular powerhouses, is a hallmark of Parkinson's disease. NAD+ is crucial for maintaining mitochondrial function, and NMN supplementation may support
                        mitochondrial health and integrity, potentially attenuating neuronal damage and degeneration in PD.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        DNA repair: NAD+ is essential for DNA repair mechanisms, and deficiencies in DNA repair capacity have been implicated in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease. By facilitating DNA repair processes, NMN
                        supplementation may help prevent or reduce DNA damage accumulation in neurons, thereby slowing disease progression.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Preclinical studies and some clinical trials have shown promising results regarding the potential benefits of NMN supplementation in Parkinson's disease, more research is needed to fully understand its efficacy in
                        humans. NMN is safe, however.

                            <p>
                                Although this study focuses on a cardiomyopathy model in Friedrich's ataxia, it provides insights into the potential benefits of NMN supplementation in a disease characterized by mitochondrial dysfunction.
                                The findings suggest that NMN administration improves cardiac function and bioenergetics through SIRT3-mediated mechanisms, highlighting the importance of NAD+ metabolism in mitochondrial health.

                <h4>Senolytics</h4>
                <p>
                    Senolytics are small molecules that selectively induce the dissolution (lysis) of senescent cells. Senolytic means "senescent cell destruction".
                </p>
                <p>
                    In PD, &alpha;-synuclein and especially its mutant forms damage mitochondria, causing a leak of sirtuins from the inner membrane of the mitochondria leading to mitochondrial failure and eventual cell failure.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Aggregates of &alpha;-synuclein form Lewy bodies inside the cell and block T-cells from activating the lysosome of non-functioning "zombie" cells.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Senolytics help prevent the formation of &alpha;-synuclein aggregates. This has numerous benefits, including neuroprotection, decreased neuroinflammation, improved mitochondrial function, neurogenesis, and autophagy.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Senolytics reduce the formation of Lewy bodies and facilitate T-cell activation of the lysosome in senescent cells by preventing obstruction by  &alpha;-synuclein aggregates
                </p>
            
                <p>
                    If senolytics can effectively enhance the immune response against alpha-synuclein aggregates, they may offer a disease-modifying treatment approach for Parkinson's disease. By targeting the underlying pathology of alpha-synuclein aggregation and promoting its clearance, senolytics could potentially slow or halt disease progression.

                    <h4>Urolithin-A (UA)</h4>
                    <p>Urolithin-A selectively eliminates senescent cells, making it senolytic. It also mitigates neurodegeneration, specifically motor symptoms, cognitive decline, and a range of non-motor symptoms in PD.</p>
                    <p>
                        UA induces mitophagy. This helps to enhance mitogenesis, the production of new mitochondria.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        UA inhibits the activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome, a key player in the development of neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In a human clinical trial, urolithin-A was shown to promote healthy muscle function during aging and improve physical function in patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), a senescence-associated disease.

                    <p>
                        UA has been found to protect against dopamine neuron degeneration and motor symptoms in PD models.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        UA has been shown to improve behavioral symptoms, such as motor function and cognitive decline, in PD models.
