        <h2>Introduction to Parkinson's Disease</h2>

        <p>
            Parkinson's Disease (PD) is a progressive neurological condition caused by aggregation of the pre-synaptic peptide &alpha;-synuclein in the midbrain, leading to loss of dopaminergic neurons resulting on motor skills defects resulting in progressive neurodegeneration (PN) characterized by motor and non-motor symptoms. 
        </p>

		<!--
        <p>
            Alpha-synuclein aggregates in the midbrain brain and damages neurons, including the autonomic nuclei, also located also throughout the body, which are responsible for autonomic functions (blood pressure, heart rate, GI system, etc).
        </p>
        <p>
            Progressive neurodegeneration ensues and is exacerbated by unilateral neurological modulation of the dopaminergic pathway (the L-Dopa / DDC inhibitors, aka "standard of care") and is more pronounced in later stages.
        </p>

        <p>
            Parkinson's Disease affects various brain regions, including the substantia nigra, basal ganglia, cerebral cortex, thalamus, hippocampus, cerebellum, and other regions involved in motor control, cognition, movement and the nervous systems.
        </p>
        -->
        <!-- p>
            The nervous system comprises the Central Nervous System (CNS), Peripheral Nervous System (PNS), and autonomic nervous system (ANS). The CNS, consisting of the brain and spinal cord, processes information and coordinates responses. The PNS connects the CNS to the body, relaying sensory input and motor output. The ANS regulates involuntary functions like heart rate and digestion.
        </p -->
        <p>
            In PD, progressive neurodegeneration (PN) primarily affects the Central Nervous System (CNS), particularly dopamine-producing neurons, leading to motor symptoms like tremors and rigidity. However, dysfunction of the autonomic nervous system (ANS) becomes more noticeably pronounced in the later stages, contributing to non-motor symptoms such as GI issues, low blood pressure, and urinary dysfunction.
        </p>
        <p>
            PD-related autonomic dysfunction can exacerbate renal issues, leading to a complex interplay of factors that contribute to orthostatic hypotension in PD.
        </p>
		<section id="causes-of-pd">
			<h3>Causes and Risk Factors</h3>
			<p>
				Parkinson's Disease is a neurological condition resulting from pathology of alpha-synuclein (α-synuclein), (α-synucleinopathy). 
				<span class="call-out">Understanding the role and effects of α-synuclein is key to mitigating the disease's progression.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				Overexpression of &alpha;-synuclein leads to its aggregation and formation of &alpha;-synuclein structures, either as oligomers (peptides) or fibrils (see image). Oligomers of &alpha;-synuclein can form Lewy bodies, abnormal
				aggregations of protein that develop inside nerve cells affected by PD.
			</p>
			
			<figure>
				<img src="img/alpha-synuclein.jpeg" alt="α-synuclein monomer, fibril, and oligomer." class="block-image">
			<figcaption>
				<p>
					Depiction of α-synuclein monomer, fibril, and oligomer. α-Synuclein fibrils are long, insoluble fibers composed of many monomers and oligomers.
				</p>
			</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<p>
				Alpha-synuclein is abundant primarily in the brain, especially in the neocortex, hippocampus, and substantia nigra (SN). Smaller amounts are found in the heart, muscles, and other tissues. It is transported into and out of the
				brain by the blood-brain barrier.
			</p>
			<p>
				Six mutations of &alpha;-synuclein are currently associated with familial parkinsonism. Mutant &alpha;-synuclein forms aggregates more readily than wild-type (normal) &alpha;-synuclein.
			</p>
			<p>
				Wild-type &alpha;-synuclein can be removed by lysosomes. Mutant forms of &alpha;-synuclein, however, resist their degradation and inhibit that of other substrates.
			</p>
			<p>
				&alpha;-synuclein oligomers play a central role in the multi-factorial causes of Parkinson&rsquo;s disease. &alpha;-synuclein oligomers, as well as other &alpha;-synuclein variants, actively participate in disrupting
				mitochondrial function, autophagy and lysosomal degradation, membrane homeostasis, Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER) function, and synapses, and can induce inflammation.
			</p>
		
		    <!-- TODO: Where does this go??
			<h4>SNCA Gene Encodes Alpha-synuclein</h4>
			<p>
				The SNCA gene encodes &alpha;-synuclein. In the brain, &alpha;-synuclein is found mainly at the tips of nerve cells (neurons) in specialized structures called presynaptic terminals.
			</p>
			<p>Mutations in the SNCA gene lead to mutant &alpha;-synuclein.</p>
			<h4>
				Autosomal Dominant Parkinson's Disease, PARK1
			</h4>
			<p>
				PARK1 is an inherited, dominant genetic trait (autosomal dominant) in PD that causes heterozygous triplication of the SNCA gene.
			</p>
			<h4>LRRK2</h4>
			<p>
				Leucine-Rich Repeat Kinase 2 (LRRK2) is an enzyme encoded by a gene of the same name (the LRRK2 gene).
			</p>
			<p>
				LRRK2 mutations are implicated in PD pathogenesis and may influence &alpha;-synuclein metabolism and neuronal function.
			</p>
			<h5>LRRK2-G2019S</h5>
			<p>
				LRRK2-G2019S is a mutant form of LRRK2 found in PD. LRRK2-G20195 causes &alpha;-synuclein accumulation in dopaminergic neurons. &alpha;-synuclein accumulation leads to all of the problems previously mentioned,
				including &alpha;-synuclein oligomers and fibrils.
			</p>
			<p>
				LRRK2 mutants in genetic PD cause shortening and simplification of the dendritic tree in vivo and in cultured neurons.
			</p>
			<p>
				LRRK2 inhibitors can improve Parkinson's disease by reducing &alpha;-synuclein.
			</p>

				PTEN-induced kinase 1 (PINK1) is a kinase produced by the PINK1 gene. Mutations in the PINK1 gene are a rare cause of one form of autosomal recessive early-onset Parkinson's disease that may be more associated with
				mitophagy, a process by which damaged or dysfunctional mitochondria are removed, reducing oxidative stress and inflammation.

						The pathological hallmarks of PD and the interplay of aging, environmental hazards, and genetics.
					</p>
					<p>
						(A) The pathological hallmarks of Parkinson’s disease include dopaminergic neuronal death, &alpha;-synuclein aggregates, mitochondrial dysfunction, reactive oxygen species, apoptosis, and neuroinﬂammation.
					</p>
					<p>
						(B) PD is a multifactorial disorder involving aging, genetics, and environmental factors, associated with dopaminergic neuronal death. Gene mutations associated with PD include DJ-1, PTEN-induced putative kinase-1 (PINK1), parkin, leucine-rich repeat kinase-2 (LRRK2), Synuclein alpha (SNAC), and ubiquitin carboxyl-terminal hydrolase-L1 (UCHL1). 
					</p>
					<p>
						Neurotoxins (e.g., rotenone, paraquat) and gene mutations of DJ-1,  PINK1, parkin, LRRK2, and SNAC, induce mitochondria complex I inhibition, ATP depletion, reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation, mitochondria depolarization, and mitochondrial dysfunction in dopaminergic neurons to promote neuronal death in the substantia nigra of PD patients.
					</p>
					<p>
						Overexpression of the SNCA gene can lead to the accumulation of  &alpha;-synuclein in the brain, which, if &alpha;-synuclein is of a mutant form can cause problems and contribute to the formation of Lewy bodies. 
					</p>
					<p>
						The UCHL1 gene and the overexpression of the SNCA gene are related in that UCHL1 is involved in the degradation of &alpha;-synuclein, a protein that is overexpressed in PD. 
					<p>
						The UCHL1 gene and the SNCA gene are both involved in PD pathogenesis.
						UCHL1 gene mutations impair ubiquitin-proteasome systems and further induce autophagy lysosomal pathway dysfunction, contributing to Lewy body formation in dopaminergic neurons.
					</p>

			<p>
				The diagram offers some visual depiction of PD, with small mistakes.
			</p>
			<p>The authors miscall the &alpha;-synuclein gene, SNCA, "SNAC". Most of what they categorize as genetic is epigenetic. That is, attributable to a combination of genetic <em>and</em> environmental factors.</p>
			<p>
				Lewy bodies are comprised of &alpha;-synuclein fibrils, the manifestation of which can be partly affected by environmental factors. Lewy bodies appear in the “Genetic factors" group below &alpha;-synuclein.
			</p>
			<p>
				&alpha;-synuclein increase is not solely attributable to genetics but to a variety of epigenetic factors that can be affected.
			</p>
			-->
			<p>
				Epigenetic factors can influence mutations in LRRK2 (LRRK2-G2019S) and cause encoding mutations in LRRK2 and SNCA genes that affect the production and pathogenicity of mutant &alpha;-synuclein.
			</p>
			<p>
				Vitamin B12, for example, is an external factor that prevents LRRK2-G2019S-potentiated &alpha;-synuclein accumulation in dopaminergic neurons.

				Pesticide and herbicide exposure causes &alpha;-synuclein overexpression in certain individuals. Rotenone and paraquat, both pesticides, so reliably induce PD that they is used to induce PD in rodents which can then be studied and treated experimentally.

				SATB1 a cell regulator, represses expression of the pro-senescence factor p21 in dopaminergic neurons.
			</p>
			<p>
				SATB1 is inhibited in Parkinson's disease. Less SATB1 means more p21 pro-senescence. Senescent dopaminergic neurons contribute to the pathology of Parkinson's disease.
			</p>
			<p>
				Senescent cells cease to function and divide, damaging healthy neighboring cells by secreting inflammatory factors and contributing to further tissue dysfunction and senescence.

			<h3>Testing and Diagnosis</h3>
			<p>
				Alpha-synuclein oligomers are higher in PD patients than in healthy subjects. This can be tested with AlphaSyn-SAA salivary test or Syn-One skin biopsy.
			</p>
			<h3>Early Testing and Diagnosis with AlphaSyn-SAA</h3>
			<p>
				The AlphaSyn-SAA salivary test measures the levels of alpha-amylase in saliva. The results are used to asses autonomic nervous system activity, particularly sympathetic nervous system activation. This test is able to, with some margin of error, identify people at risk of developing Parkinson’s disease <em>up to ten years</em> before symptoms appear. 
			</p>
			<h3>Syn-One</h3>
			<p>
				The Syn-One skin biopsy detects the presence of phosphorylated alpha-synuclein in the skin. This is a much more accurate test than the AlphaSyn-SAA, and is usually used as confirmation, rather than a preventive diagnostic.

				<h4>Genetic Testing</h4>
				<p>
					Most cases of Parkinson's Disease are not classified as genetic. Genetic testing for PD is not routinely performed. The lack of testing is due to the fact that only about 15% of cases are determined to be genetic. It's a classic case of <dfn>absence of evidence</dfn>.
				</p>
				<p>
					Genetic testing for PD can help better inform and guide its treatment.
					Genes associated with PD may have varying effects on disease progression. (See also: <a href="#https://www.michaeljfox.org/what-know-about-genetic-testing"
					>What to Know about Genetic Testing</a>)
				</p>
		
				<p>
					None of the genetic types should be excluded from the proposed treatments in the problems list, but the specific focus and approach would differ based on the genetic mutation and its associated molecular pathway. Familiarize yourself with your genetic type, the associated treatments for it included herein and elsewhere, and communicate this with your care team.
				</p>
				<h5>Test Your Children</h5>
				<p>
					Children of PD patients should be tested <em>before</em> they exhibit symptoms similar to those of PD. Symptoms may take up to 10 years to present. 
				</p>
				
				<h5>Testing Locations</h5>
		
				<p>
				Genetic testing for these mutations can be done at specialized medical centers and genetic testing companies. Some notable places include:

        <p>
            Optimal health describes a state of physical and mental functioning, not merely absence of disease. Healthcare professionals often describe optimal health from a very high-level with with crude descriptors. We could do better.
        </p>
        <p>
            The first step to optimizing one's health is understanding his general condition and some basic understanding of cellular health, neurology, and the human organism (we've barely scratched the surface).

            <li>Optimal levels of inflammation and oxidative stress 
        </ol>
    
        But we could go deeper:
        <ol>
            <li>Resting heart rate below 60 beats per minute
            <li>Normal blood pressure (around 120/80 mmHg)
            <li>Balanced blood glucose levels (around 70-100 mg/dL)
            <li>Adequate levels of essential vitamins and minerals
            <li>Optimal lipid profile with low LDL and high HDL cholesterol
            <li>Healthy body composition (adequate muscle mass, low body fat)

            <li>Well-functioning organs and systems, including cardiovascular, respiratory, digestive, and nervous systems
        </ol>
    
        Deeper yet:
        <ol>
            <li>Balanced hormone levels regulating various physiological processes.
            <li>Well-maintained organ function with efficient metabolic processes.
            <li>Healthy immune system response to pathogens and foreign invaders.

            <li>Measurement of neurotransmitter levels in bodily fluids with chromatography.

            <li>Analysis of cytokine levels in blood or cerebrospinal fluid through ELISA or PCR methods.
            <li>Evaluation of mitochondrial function through assays measuring ATP production, membrane potential, and oxidative stress levels.
        </ol>
        
        <p>
            Monitoring and testing brain health involves specialized assessments that require a deeper understanding of neurobiology and physiology. Understanding the interplay between that and some of the recommendations in this guide (LD/DCC, melatonin, PBM, mitochondrial quinones), requires an extraordinary mind. Developing a care plan around that is monumentally difficult, not just for the complexity of the problem, but for the dearth of professionals up to the task.
        </p>
        <p>
            Those who take their condition seriously and employ the best strategies to mitigate the progression of the disease will enjoy greater quality of life and longevity. The tired "ask to your doctor" mantra does not lead greater self-empowerment through understanding and does not apply here. Learn, you must.

		    	<h3>Tips for Selecting Providers</h3>
				<p>
					Referrals can begin with your PCP, a neurologist, or functional medicine specialist. Where you start doesn't matter; the goal is to build a complete care team. 
				</p>
				<p>
					Some doctors are subject to protocols or guidelines established by their institution's medical board or regulatory bodies, and this can influence their treatment decisions. Seek a neurologist with the autonomy and openness to exploring novel, evidence-based treatments beyond the standard of care.
				</p>
				<p>
					Patient-centered care that is complete, addresses the root cause, is individualized, and evidence-based can predict the best results. Starting with a Functional and Integrative Medicine Specialist can be great. However, to avoid unqualified practitioners, it's essential to be well-informed.
				</p>
				<p>
					During your initial consultation with the neurologist, clearly communicate your interest with optimizing total health to keep dopamine replacement to a minimum. Discuss specific treatments such as <a href="#hrt" title="hormone replacement therapy">HRT</a>, <a title="Photobiomodulation" href="#pbm">PBM</a>, and <a href="#5-htp">5-HTP</a>, and how they might interact with dopamine replacement. If the doctor cannot explain their benefits or potential interactions, consider finding another doctor.

			<h4>The Role of Nutrition</h4>
            <p>
                Nutritional deficiencies can exacerbate symptoms in individuals with PD and may sometimes be mistaken for progressive neurodegeneration. This misinterpretation can lead to inappropriate management strategies if the underlying nutritional issues are not addressed.
            </p>
            <p>
                Furthermore, certain nutrient deficiencies can trigger cascading effects, exacerbating PD symptoms or hasten the decline of the condition. For example, deficiencies in vitamins B12, folate, and vitamin D have been implicated in PD and can affect neurological function and overall health. Inadequate intake of essential nutrients can also impair mitochondrial function, increase oxidative stress, and compromise neurotransmitter synthesis and signaling, all of which are implicated in PD pathophysiology.
            </p>
            <p>
                Additionally, levodopa/carbidopa therapy can reduce vitamin B6 levels, which is essential for the synthesis of neurotransmitters.
            </p>
            <p>
                It's crucial to build a comprehensive plan that strikes a balance between supplementation, nutrition, lifestyle, and regular monitoring to slow disease progression.
            </p>
            <p>
                Don't just "talk to your doctor", collaborate with a team of healthcare professionals with multiple specialties to create individualized treatment plans that include nutrition, lifestyle, supplementation, and medication. Regularly test and monitor status with symptoms and biochemical markers to assess the effectiveness of interventions and make adjustments as needed.

            </p>
            <p>
                It is necessary to work with doctors who focus on what works. Focus on the facts and evidence, consider risk/reward, and work on total health. Avoid doctors who won't look at the evidence you present them.
            </p>
            
            <h4>What Do Doctors Miss?</h4>
            <p>
                Doctors typically prioritize symptoms over addressing the underlying causes. Specifically, they tend to focus on the dopamine pathway with medications like levodopa/carbidopa, to enhance dopamine levels in the brain, and COMT inhibitors, to inhibit its breakdown by catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT).
            </p>
            <p>
                Approaches to mitigating the underlying cause can extend longevity, improve quality of life, and reduce the dependence on medication which is not without side effects. Address these key areas for a more comprehensive approach to managing PD. (For solutions, see: <a href="#problem-list">Problem List</a>)

            <p>
                Many approaches overlap more than one problem area and have synergistic benefits. For example, 5-HTP is converted into serotonin in the brain. It inhibits the release of glutamate, mitigates oxidation modulates dopamine
                release, improves mitochondrial function, and improves sleep, which improves overall health, leading to a better sense of well-being and better exercise capacity and recovery.

                <h4>Dopamine Replacement Therapy — Overview</h4>
            
                <p>
                    Dopamine replacement therapy (DRT) for PD commonly includes levodopa/carbidopa (LD/DCC) and MAO-B inhibitors. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Replenishing dopamine levels in the brain helps alleviate motor symptoms such as tremors, rigidity, and bradykinesia (slowness, freezing), improving patients' quality of life. However, dopamine replacement therapy has other effects, good and bad.
                </p>
            
                <h4>Impact of Dopamine Agonists</h4>

                <h5>Fibrillization</h5>
                <p>
                    Dopamine agonists inhibit fibrillization by reacting with the α-synuclein. This is an advantage, as fibrils contribute to cellular damage, senescent cells, and neurodegeneration. However, it does so by an oxidative process that, in excess, also contributes to cellular damage and neurodegeneration. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    Alpha-synuclein fibrillization inhibition must be balanced to both minimize and mitigate oxidative stress, and this requires a multi-faceted approach. 
                </p>
            
                <h5>Neurochemical and Vitamin Imbalances</h5>
                <p>
                    Dopamine agonists also deplete active vitamin B6 levels in the body. They do this by irreversibly binding to and permanently deactivating pyridoxal 5’-phosphate (P5P), the active form of vitamin B6. This leads to various side effects and exacerbates the progression of the disease, as B6 is essential for dopamine synthesis and is involved in other metabolic pathways.
                </p>

                <h5>Progressive Neurodegeneration</h5>
                <p>
                    Dopamine is but one of many neurochemical systems in the midbrain. Focusing solely on the dopaminergic system without considering other neurotransmitter systems leads to progressive neurodegeneration (PN) exacerbating motor and non-motor symptoms.
                </p>
                        
                <h4>Dopamine Replacement Therapy — Summary</h4>
                <p>
                    Therefore, while dopamine replacement is beneficial, its use can be minimized to the least effective dose with a multi-faceted approach that addresses neuroprotection, neurorestoration, antioxidation, and mitochondrial health.

                    Pregnenolone is fat-soluble and crosses the BBB. Once in the brain, pregnenolone can be converted into other neurosteroids, such as allopregnanolone, which have various effects on neuronal function and behavior.

                    Several clinical studies have investigated pregnenolone as a treatment for Parkinson’s disease. One study found that pregnenolone dose-dependently countered L-DOPA-induced dyskinesias (LIDs) without affecting L-DOPA-induced motor improvements.

                <p>
                    Dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) is a hormone produced by the adrenal glands, the ovaries, and the brain. It is a precursor to both estrogen and testosterone and is converted into estrogen and testosterone in peripheral tissues.
                </p>
                <p>
                    DHEA is also involved in the regulation of sleep, memory, and cholesterol levels.
                </p>
                <p>
                    DHEA is neuroprotective effects, which may help protect against the progression of PD. This is due to its ability to modulate memory formation, regulate neuronal activity, and enhance or restore memory and learning processes.
                </p>
                <p>Like pregnenolone, DHEA is lipid-soluble, which allows it to cross the BBB relatively easily, and is available as a dietary supplement. Recommended dosage is 100mg ED.

            <h3>Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS)</h3>
            <p>
                Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS) uses electrodes implanted in the brain to deliver electrical impulses to the globus pallidus internus (GPi). This helps to regulate brain activity.
            </p>
            
            <h4>LRRK2-G2019S and DBS</h4>
            <p>
            	LRRK2-G2019S mutations, especially, tend to have relatively good outcomes with DBS compared to other genetic types. 
        	</p>
        	
            <p>
                DBS of the (GPi) primarily targets the GABAergic output neurons of the basal ganglia, influencing motor output and reducing motor symptoms in PD. However, the therapeutic effects of GPi stimulation in PD extend beyond
                modulating GABAergic transmission within the basal ganglia circuitry and can indirectly impact cortical glutamatergic input to the basal ganglia.
            </p>
            <p>
                While GPi stimulation primarily targets the GABAergic output of the basal ganglia, the dopaminergic system remains crucial in PD pathology and treatment. Dopamine depletion in the basal ganglia is a hallmark feature of
                PD and leads to motor symptoms such as bradykinesia, tremors, and rigidity, and DBS helps treat these problems.
            </p>
            <p>
                Other neurotransmitter systems affected by DBS include the serotonergic, cholinergic, noradrenergic, and glutamatergic systems. Due to the delicate balance between all these systems stimulation of the entire GPi can more
                easily achieve a positive, balanced effect, compared to medication and supplementation with l-dopa/carbidopa and supplements like 5-HTP and GABA.
            </p>
            <p>
                This normalizes basal ganglion activity resulting in reduced excitotoxicity, better neuronal function, and greater cell longevity.
            </p>
            <p>
                Medication alone leads to PN. DBS reduces the need for medication, thus mitigating PN. Supplementation further reduces the need for medication, and thus PN. A team of specialists to craft a program with DBS, medication,
                and supplementation may offer the best possible outcome with the least PN and greater longevity.
            </p>
            <p>
                Crafting a personalized treatment program that incorporates DBS, medication, and supplementation requires the expertise of a multidisciplinary team of specialists, including neurologists, movement disorder specialists,
                neurosurgeons, pharmacists, dietitians, and other healthcare professionals. This team can collaborate to tailor treatment to the individual patient's needs, optimize therapy, and minimize PN.

                Physical Therapy / Exercise
            </h3>
            <p>
                Exercise has many positive impacts on general health. In PD, exercise improves motor and non-motor symptoms.
            </p>
            <p>
                Exercise increases brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and autophagy (recycling of senescent cells), downregulates proinflammatory cytokines, and lowers blood sugar.
            </p>
            
            <h4>Mitochondrial Benefits</h4>
            <p>
                Regular, frequent exercise has been shown to upregulate NAD+ biosynthesis pathways and increase cellular NAD+ levels. Exercise-induced activation of cellular signaling pathways, such as AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and sirtuins, stimulates mitochondrial biogenesis and enhances mitochondrial function in neuronal cells. Additionally, exercise promotes mitochondrial turnover and quality control mechanisms, such as mitophagy, which help maintain a healthy mitochondrial pool.

                    Improves kidney function — PD impairs kidney function through Alpha-synuclein impairment via aggregation accumulation and inflammation, autonomic nervous system dysfunction, and dopamine depletion (dopamine plays a
                    crucial role in regulating blood pressure and kidney function.)
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Parkinson’s disease kidney impairment happens from the start but becomes more of a problem during later stages of the disease. Start early; don't wait.

            <p>
                Near-infrared (NIR) Light (700-1100 nm) penetrates deeper into tissues, making it a better choice for targeting deeper affected brain regions.
            </p>

            <p>
                Red light can be effective, too, but the longer duration and stronger intensity required for efficacy may overstimulate skin. If you have a device that allows for a blend of NIR and red frequencies, use a lower intensity
                for the red frequencies to glean their dermal benefits while getting more intense NIR for the deep regions of the brain.
            </p>
            
            <h4>Oxidative Stress and Inflammation</h4>
            
            <p>
                PBM has anti-inflammatory effects, which can help mitigate the inflammatory response associated with ischemic injury, reducing tissue damage and promoting healing.
            </p>
            
            <h4>Ischemia and Blood Flow</h4>
            <p>
                PBM has been shown to increase local blood flow and oxygenation in ischemic     tissues, which can help alleviate hypoxia (low oxygen levels) and promote tissue recovery.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Ischemia can affect the delivery of therapeutic agents to the desired target in the midbrain. During ischemic events, blood flow to affected brain regions can be significantly compromised, limiting the delivery of oxygen and nutrients, and therapeutic compounds like melatonin.
            </p>
                
            <p>
                The timing of PBM, in conjunction with the administration of substances like melatonin, can play a role in potentially mitigating the effects of ischemic inhibition on nutrient delivery to the midbrain.
            </p>

            <p>
                Near-infrared (NIR) light has a deeper penetration depth than red light, allowing it to reach deeper tissues and organs, including the brain, without overstimulating the skin.

            			<h4>The Role of Nutrition</h4>
            <p>
                Nutritional deficiencies can exacerbate symptoms in individuals with PD and may sometimes be mistaken for progressive neurodegeneration. This misinterpretation can lead to inappropriate management strategies if the underlying nutritional issues are not addressed.
            </p>
            <p>
                Furthermore, certain nutrient deficiencies can trigger cascading effects, exacerbating PD symptoms or hastening PN. For example, deficiencies in vitamins B12, folate, and vitamin D have been implicated in PD and can affect neurological function and overall health. Inadequate intake of essential nutrients can also impair mitochondrial function, increase oxidative stress, and compromise neurotransmitter synthesis and signaling, all of which are implicated in PD pathophysiology.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Additionally, LD/DDC therapy can reduce vitamin B6 levels, which is essential for the synthesis of neurotransmitters.
            </p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Mechanisms: Antioxidant, Anti-inflammatory, Mitochondrial
                    <li>Dose: 3g per day 💤

                    <li>Efficacy rating: 5/10 (70% σ)
                </ul>
                <p>
                    GlyNAC improves glutathione levels, improves mitochondrial function, reduces inflammation, supports neurotrophic factor expression, and improves cognitive function.
                </p>

                <h4>Supplementation</h4>
                <p>
                     GlyNAC supplementation up to 7.2g per day is safe and well tolerated in older adults. GlyNAC is best taken at night.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    GlyNAC improves sleep quality. The half-life of NAC in the body is about 6 hours, and the half-life of glycine is anywhere from 25-250 minutes, so taking it at night allows for optimal utilization of the amino acids.
                </p>
                
                <h4>Side Effects</h4>
                <p>
                    N-Acetyl Cysteine (NAC) can cause next-day lethargy. If you experience that, reduce the dose, take it earlier in the evening, and sleep earlier.

                    Creatine has been studied extensively in PD and repeatedly shown to not slow the disease. So why is it recommended here? 
                </p>
                
                <h4>Creatine + Exercise</h4>
                <p>
                    Creatine is recommended an adjuvant therapy with an exercise program to maximize overall effectiveness. Creatine has well-established benefits on muscular strength, exercise recovery, mitochondrial function, and anti-oxidant effects. Exercise plays a fundamental role in health optimization.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Creatine helps mitochondrial function by directly increasing ATP synthesis. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    Creatine increases mitochondrial ATP production, provides antioxidant effects, and reduces oxidative stress and mitochondrial damage. Its neuroprotective properties have been demonstrated to protect against neuronal damage and prevent cell death.
                </p>
                
                <h4>Supplementation</h4>
                
                <p>
                Taking creatine with food improves absorption. Eating increases the production of insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1), which helps facilitate creatine uptake.
                </p>
                 
                <h4>Safety and Efficacy</h4>
                <p>
                    Creatine is commonly used with minimal adverse effects reported in clinical studies.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Creatine supplementation alone may not significantly slow the progression of Parkinson's disease, its neuroprotective and antioxidant effects contribute to overall disease management when used as part of a comprehensive treatment approach, particularly in combination with exercise, to stave off disease progression in the early stages of the disease.

                <!--
                <h4>Antifibrillogenic and Anti-aggregant</h4>
            Compounds in cacao may help prevent the formation and aggregation of α-synuclein fibrils. These include epicatechin, catechin, procyanidins, theobromine
            
            Theobromine (dimethylxanthine) is the primary methylxanthine in cacao, contributing to the overall pharmacological profile of cacao to a greater extend than the other methylxanthines theophylline and caffeine (trimethylxanthine).
            
            Theobromine chelate metal ions and inhibit enzymes involved in ROS generation, rather than directly scavenging ROS and RNS.
            
             has but its mechanism of action in reducing α-synuclein fibril aggregation is not primarily dopaminergic.
             
             Theobromine inhibits NADPH Oxidase. NADPH oxidizes NADP responsible for generating reactive oxygen species (ROS) in various cells. NADPH oxidase is implicated in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s diseases.


Neuroprotective and Antioxidant: Cacao's flavonoids possess antioxidant properties, potentially protecting neuronal structures from oxidative stress, which is implicated in PD progression.

Anti-inflammatory: Some components of cacao may have anti-inflammatory effects, which could help reduce neuroinflammation associated with PD.

Neurorestorative: By promoting mitochondrial health and possibly enhancing cellular processes like mitophagy, cacao might facilitate the recovery and regeneration of neural tissue in PD.


Sleep: Cacao contains compounds like theobromine, which may have stimulant effects, but individual responses to cacao consumption can vary regarding its impact on sleep. Moderate consumption may not significantly affect sleep patterns for most individuals.

Senolytic: While cacao has not been directly studied as a senolytic agent, its antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties may indirectly contribute to cellular health and potentially impact senescent cells.

                    <h5>Introduction to Turmeric and Curcuminoids</h5>
                    <p>
                        Turmeric is a rhizome of the Curcuma longa plant.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Curcumin is the most well-known and studied curcuminoind found in turmeric. Other curcuminoids contribute to turmeric's health benefits. Herein, the terms are used interchangeably.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                        Curcumin crosses the blood-brain barrier to reach deep brain structures, including the midbrain, where it directly exerts its beneficial effects. 
                    </p>

                    <h4>How Turmeric Helps PD</h4>
                    <p>
                        Several studies in different experimental models of PD strongly support the use of curcumin in PD. Specifically, with neuroprotection, neurogenesis, antifibrillogenic, and anti-aggregation. These actions contribute to a healthier brain, improved cognitive function, and a staving off of progressive neurodegeneration (PN).
                    </p>

                    <h4>Supplementation (Eating Turmeric)</h4>

                    <p>
                        Turmeric is very safe at 1-3g daily. Excessively high doses may cause stomach upset or strain the kidneys.
                    </p>

                    <h4>Challenges with Curcumin Absorption</h4>
                    <p>
                        Although curcumin pills are convenient, orally-ingested curcumin is very poorly absorbed. What is absorbed is quickly metabolized.
                    </p>
                
                    <h4>Self-Emulsifying Drug Delivery Systems SEDDS</h4>
                    <p> 
                        Self-Emulsifying Drug Delivery Systems (SEDDS) are lipid-based formulations that create an emulsion to improve the oral bioavailability of lipophilic substances, like curcumin.
                    </p>
                
                    <h4>Enhancing Absorption with Food</h4>
                    <p>                         
                        Turmeric is good in curries, with vegetables and coconut oil, offering both flavor and health benefits. This formulation with food offers much better absorption as a SEDDS. Turmeric can also be blended into warm milk with other spices, as <dfn>"golden milk"</dfn>.
                    </p>
                    
                    <h4>Safety Concerns</h4>
                    
                    <p>
                        Turmeric thins the blood, which may increase the risk of bleeding, especially in individuals taking blood-thinning medications or those with bleeding disorders or are planning surgery. It may interact with blood-thinners, diabetes medications, and medications that reduce stomach acid production.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Consuming excessively high amounts of turmeric (over 5g ED) may lead to gastrointestinal issues or increase the risk of kidney stone formation, particularly in individuals prone to kidney stones or with a history of kidney problems.
                    </p>

            	<p>
                	 Glial cells, and specifically astrocytes, support the function and survival of neurons. Astrocytes can release neurotransmitters, such as glutamate and ATP, which can influence neuronal activity.
            	</p>
            	<p>
            		Glial scar formation is a common pathological feature in various central nervous system (CNS) diseases, including Parkinson’s disease (PD). In PD, the glial scars form around damaged dopaminergic neurons, blocking their repair.
				</p>
                <p>
                	Saffron inhibits damage and inflammation to astrocytes (glia) through multiple pathways.

                	Because saffron is fat-soluble, it's best taken with food. (It's also delicious.) Saffron can be drunk with turmeric and cinnamon in golden milk. Excessive amounts may cause bloating and gas.

                    EGCG (epigallocatechin gallate), a component in Green Tea, inhibits the ability of preformed oligomers, such as oligomers of &alpha;-synuclein, to permeabilize vesicles and induce cytotoxicity in rat brain cells.

                    </em>
                    Green tea contains moderate levels of fluoride, a neurotoxin. Matcha, a Japanese powdered green tea, which contains high levels of EGCG also, unfortunately, has slightly high levels of oxalates. Oxalates contribute to
                    inflammation and damage kidneys. Supplemental ECCG can provide the desired dose without the fluoride oxalate concentrations found in green tea.

                <p>
                    ALCAR directly affects mitochondrial respiration.
                </p>
                <p>
                    ALCAR protects dopaminergic neurons by abrogating neuroinflammation, apoptosis, astrogliosis, and oxidative stress. For PD, ALCAR protects cells against the accumulation of alpha-synuclein.

                <ul class="treatment-rating">
                    <li>Mechanisms: Neuroprotective, Antioxidant, Mitochondrial</li>
                    <li>Dose:  250-500 mg ED ☀️</li>

                <p>
                    R-Alpha-Lipoic Acid (r-ALA) reduces mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative damage, thereby protecting dopaminergic neurons in Parkinson's disease.
                </p>
                
                <h4>Supplement Forms: s- and r-Enantiomers, and Binding</h4>

                <p>
                    Most research on ALA uses both s- and r-isoforms. The synthetically produced s-form inhibits the absorption of the naturally occurring r-isomer, which has better bioavailability. 
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    Na-r-ALA (sodium-bound r-ALA) has better absorption and stability.
                </p>

                <h4>How r-ALA Works</h4>
                
                <p>
                    R-ALA activates <abbr title="AMP-activated protein kinase">AMPK</abbr>, which stimulates mitophagy. This leads to mitochondrial biogenesis and improved mitochondrial function. It increases glucose uptake and decreases glucose production in the liver, resulting in enhanced insulin sensitivity and reduced oxidative stress.
                </p>
                
                <h4>R-ALA in Parkinson's Disease</h4>
                <p>
                     Insulin resistance (IR) is commonly associated with an increased risk of developing Parkinson’s disease. IR leads to elevated brain glucose, which damages brain cells and accelerates neurodegeneration.
                </p>
                <p>
                    R-ALA decreases intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) and iron levels. High iron levels harm dopaminergic neurons, inducing cell death and leading to more severe motor deficits with mutant α-synuclein.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    Overexpression of α-synuclein inhibits AMPK activity, contributing to the neurodegenerative process in PD.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    While r-ALA improves upon some aspects of PD pathology, based on current evidence, its effectiveness is moderate, partly contingent upon insulin sensitivity, and best incorporated as an adjuvant.
                </p>
                <h4>Synergy</h4>
                <h5>Na-r-ALA, Creatine, ALCAR, and Carbohydrates</h5>
                <p>
                    Taking r-ALA with carbohydrates and creatine monohydrate enhances the uptake of these nutrients into brain and muscle cells.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    ALCAR helps transport fatty acids into the mitochondria, where they can be converted into energy. R-ALA, an antioxidant, helps protect the mitochondria from damage, allowing them to function more efficiently. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Combining ALCAR, r-ALA, and creatine can amplify their neuroprotective effects, making this combination a potent pre-workout mitochondrial activator.
                </p>
                <h4>Side Effects</h4>
                <p>
                    Gastrointestinal upset can occur. Some individuals experience this when taking Na-r-ALA on a full stomach, but not when taking r-ALA in the morning with water and fruit.

                <h3>GABA, 5-HTP, and Melatonin</h3>
                <p>
                    GABA, 5-HTP, and melatonin can help PD patients through multiple neurological pathways. They're grouped because they all promote sleep and should all be taken at night.
                </p>
                <h4>Dopaminergic, Serotonergic, and GABAergic Systems</h4>
                <p>
                    The dopaminergic, serotonergic, and GABAergic systems are three important and interdependent neurotransmitter systems in the brain that play critical roles in regulating various physiological and psychological processes. All are impacted by PD and all are interrelated. Doctors typically only address the dopaminergic system, leading to imbalances in the other systems, nutrient deficiencies, and progressive neurodegeneration (PN).
                </p>
                <p>
                    Addressing only the dopaminergic system without considering the broader neurochemical landscape results in inadequate management of PD symptoms, exacerbates non-motor symptoms, and leads treatment-related complications. Furthermore, medications used to manage PD symptoms, such as levodopa, modulate only the dopaminergic system. This lopsided approach impacts other neurotransmitter systems and can contribute to nutrient deficiencies or imbalances.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It is crucial to take a comprehensive approach to PD management that considers the interplay between neurotransmitter systems and addresses both motor and non-motor symptoms. This may involve a combination of pharmacological interventions, lifestyle modifications, and nutritional support to optimize patient outcomes and quality of life while minimizing potential side effects and complications associated with treatment.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A comprehensive approach to PD must consider not only the direct effects of medications but also their broader implications for nutritional status and metabolic function.

                        GABA is an inhibitory neurotransmitter that regulates dopaminergic neuron activity in the brain.

                    <h4>GABA and Sleep</h4>
                    <p>
                        GABA supplementation improves sleep by interacting with neurotransmitter systems in both the enteric nervous system (ENS) of the gastrointestinal tract and peripheral nervous system (PNS) receptors in the brainstem. This interaction influences the vagus nerve, leading to relaxation and better sleep quality.
                    </p>

                    <h4>GABA and Dopaminergic Side Effects</h4>
                    <p>
                        In Parkinson’s disease, the loss of GABAergic neurons in the substantia nigra contributes to motor symptoms.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Dyskinesia is a common side effect of long-term treatment with levodopa in Parkinson’s disease. GABA supplementation at 1000mg daily has the potential to help regulate dopamine release and likely ameliorate dyskinesia. 
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                        Non-pharmacological approaches, such as physical therapy and deep brain stimulation (DBS) targeting GABAergic circuits, may also help manage motor complications.

                        PD affects not only the dopaminergic system but also other neurotransmitter systems, including the serotonergic system. It does this by affecting causing a gradual and nonlinear degeneration of serotonergic
                        terminals, which is associated with the development of non-motor symptoms and complications. Insufficient serotonin production or function has been linked to GI dysfunction, a common problem in PD, and may be related
                        to visual hallucinations in some patients.

                        L-dopa/Carbidopa therapy interferes with nutrient metabolism. For example, this drug combination can reduce vitamin B6 levels, which is essential for the synthesis of other neurotransmitters.

                        5-HTP is converted into serotonin in the brain. It inhibits the release of glutamate, mitigates oxidation, and modulates dopamine release.

                        The effects of PD on the serotonergic system are vastly understated. Several studies have shown serotonergic dysfunction in Parkinson's disease is associated with the development of motor and non-motor symptoms and

                    <h4>Melatonin</h4>
                    <p>
                        Melatonin is a hormone produced by the pineal gland, a small endocrine gland located in the midbrain between the two hemispheres.
                    </p>
                
                    <h5>Neuroprotective:</h5>
                    <p>
                        Melatonin protects neurons, especially against oxidative stress, a problem exacerbated by PD, leading to progressive neurodegeneration (PN). 
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Melatonin's role in protecting neurons against oxidative stress is particularly significant in neurodegenerative diseases like PD. By scavenging free radicals and enhancing the activity of antioxidative enzymes, such as superoxide dismutase, glutathione peroxidase, and glutathione reductase, melatonin slows the progression of neurodegeneration.
                    </p>
                
                    <p>
                        Melatonin receptors MT1 and MT2 in the substantia nigra are reduced in PD patients. Supplementing melatonin helps amend this deficit.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Melatonin's neuroprotective effects, bolstered by its anti-inflammatory effects, may contribute to the preservation of MT1 and MT1 receptors.
                    </p>
                                
                    <p>
                        Melatonin's anti-inflammatory properties may further contribute to its neuroprotective effects in PD, as inflammation is also implicated in the pathogenesis of the disease.

                    <p>
                        PQQ is a naturally occurring coenzyme manufactured by bacteria, found in plants in tiny amounts, and utilized by mammalian cells as an important nutritional growth factor. PQQ is not produced endogenously in humans.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        PQQ has multiple beneficial effects, including preventing the formation of &alpha;-synuclein fibrils, strengthening mitochondria, promoting mitochondrial biogenesis in brain cells, improving cognitive deficits from oxidative damage, inhibiting senescence, and enhancing memory, attention, cognition, and learning. It also increases blood flow to the cerebral cortex, protects against cell damage from pesticides, prevents neurodegeneration due to oxidative stress, and reduces LDL cholesterol to inhibit osteoporosis.
                    </p>
                    
                    <h4>Supplementation</h4>
                    <p>
                        50mg-200mg per day PQQ is very safe. It is fat-soluble and best taken with other fat-soluble supplements and food.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In 2017, the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) Panel on Dietetic Products determined a No Observed Adverse Effect Level (NOAEL) of 100mg/kg per day for 90 days. For a 50kg woman, this translates to a dose of 5g per day. Other studies have investigated PQQ's benefits and safety using similar dosages.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Given the vast multitude of benefits that occur on the cellular level, and especially by reducing alpha-synuclein fibrils relevant to PD sufferers, and the incredibly high safety threshold, a recommended dose of PQQ is 100-200mg per day. There are no known contraindications.
                    </p>
                    
                    <h4>Side Effects</h4>
                    <p>
                        Mild headaches and insomnia when taking PQQ at night. Higher doses (e.g., 100-200 mg per day) are well-tolerated and might offer more pronounced effects. Start with a lower dose 50 mg per day and work your way up.
                    </p>

                        Ubiquinol is the reduced form of CoQ10. Ubiquinol is better absorbed by the body than ubiquinone, the oxidized form of CoQ10.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>

                    <p>
                        Previous studies using ubiquinone showed a lack of effect in PD patients. However, unlike ubiquinone, ubiquinol, the reduced form of CoQ10, has shown to be effective.

                    <p>
                        Mitochondrial dysfunction is a problem in the pathogenesis of PD. Impaired mitochondrial function leads to increased oxidative stress and reduced ATP production, exacerbating neuronal damage. This dysfunction compromises cellular energy metabolism and impairs the ability of neurons to maintain their normal functions. Defective mitochondria contribute to the accumulation of toxic protein aggregates, including alpha-synuclein, leading to lewy bodys, leading to senescence, further exacerbating neurodegeneration. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Addressing mitochondrial dysfunction in Parkinson's disease requires a multifaceted approach. High-dose CoQ10 supplementation is one way to improve mitochondrial function.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Multiple system atrophy (MSA) is progressive neurodegeneration characterized by autonomic failure in various forms of Parkinsonism.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In studies show that CoQ10 supplementation can reduce apoptosis in neurons derived from MSA patients. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        CoQ10 plays an essential role in mitochondrial electron transport (<abbr title="electron transport chain">ETC</abbr>), transferring electrons and protons across the mitochondrial inner membrane to generate cellular energy.
                    </p>

                    <h5>Supplementation</h5>
                    <p>
                        Ubiquinol has been demonstrated to be superior to ubiquinone. Phytosome Q10 has been shown to provide even greater absorption, but research shows strong safety and efficacy of ubiquinol, making it a reliable option for CoQ10 supplementation.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In a study published in The Lancet, a patient with advanced Multiple System Atrophy (MSA) showed restored brain oxygen consumption after taking 1200 mg of oral ubiquinol. This finding suggests a potential benefit of ubiquinol supplementation in MSA patients, possibly related to its role in supporting mitochondrial function.

                <ul class="treatment-rating">
                    <li>Mechanisms: Mitochondrial, Dopaminergic side-effects, Antioxidant
                    <li>Dose: 150 mg per day 🍽️
                    <li>🩸🧠BBB: ✅? (probably)
                    <li>Safety: 9/10 (85%)
                    <li>Efficacy: 5/10 (30%)
                </ul>
                <p>
                    Geranylgeraniol (GG) is an essential precursor for CoQ10, vitamin K2, and testosterone biosynthesis. It also plays a role in protein synthesis and modification. 
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    GG is synthesized naturally within the human body through the mevalonate (cholesterol) pathway, but its production decreases with age. This decline in GG synthesis can lead to decreased production of CoQ10, vitamin K2, and testosterone.
                </p>
                                                                                
                <h4>GG and Parkinson’s Disease</h4>
                <p>
                    GG can <em>probably</em> cross the BBB (molecules with a molecular weight &lt; 400 <abbr title="daltons">Da</abbr> can cross it) and, if it does, this would confer an advantage over supplementation of CoQ10 and K2. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Dopamine synthesis is energetically demanding, relying on cellular energy. CoQ10 acts as a vital energy substrate for brain mitochondria, supporting their function and facilitating dopamine production. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    Given the uncertainty regarding CoQ10's BBB permeability, supplementing GG may ensure CoQ10 availability in the brain.
                </p>
                <h4>Mechanism of Action</h4>
                <p>
                    GG is used to convert mevalonic acid, the precursor for cholesterol, to CoQ10 and K2, and sex hormones. 
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    CoQ10 and vitamin K2 are primarily synthesized endogenously in the body and the brain. Evidence suggests that some forms of CoQ10 and vitamin K2 can cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB), however, this is not firmly established. 
                </p>

                <h4>Supplementation</h4>
                <p>
                    GG extracted from annatto is used to produce GG, a fat-soluble, orally-bioavailable supplement that probably crosses the BBB and aids in CoQ10 biosynthesis. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    Supplementing geranyl geraniol is considered very safe because the body has a natural regulatory mechanism to keep levels from exceeding a healthy range.

                <h4>
                    Uridine Monophoshate (uridine-5&rsquo;-monophosphate, UMP)
                </h4>
                <p>
                    Uridine is a type of nucleoside, a fundamental component of nucleic acids. Nucleic acids are the building blocks of life, and they play a crucial role in the storage and transmission of genetic information.
                </p>
                <h5>How it Works</h5>
                <p>
                    Uridine increases CDP choline. As explained under the section DHA &amp; Uridine, Uridine restores unilateral dopaminergic neurotransmission caused by oxidopamine lesions.
                </p>
                <p>
                    UMP is a precursor to the synthesis of brain phospholipids, which are important for cell membrane structure and function. It has been shown to support memory, learning, and overall cognitive function.
                </p>

                <p>
                    <strong>❌ CAUTION </strong>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Contrary to dying myth, acetylcholine does not cause the tremors of PD. The drugs given to reduce CDP choline in PD, such as Trihexyphenidyl and Benztropine, not only don't help PD, they cause confusion, memory issues, hallucinations, dry mouth, blurry vision, and urinary retention problems — serious side effects.
                </p>
                <p><em>Increasing</em> choline by 1,200 mg of supplemental citicoline improved tremors in PD and allowed patients to halve their L-dopa + dopa decarboxylase inhibitor dose. Uridine increases CDP.</p>
                <p>
                    It's important to have a healthcare provider that understands and accounts for this as part of a holistic plan.

                    Citicoline (CDP Choline)
                </h4>
                <p>
                    As mentioned in the uridine discussion, citicoline supplementation halves L-Dopa / dopa decarboxylase dosage. Citicoline is neuroprotective.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In patients with chronic cerebral ischemia, citicoline improves scores in cognitive rating scales. 
                </p>
           
                <p>     
                    Citicoline neuroprotectives effects through multiple pathways. It reduces glutamate excitotoxicity and oxidative stress, reduces glutamate excitotoxicity and oxidative stress, increases neurotrophin levels, enhances neurotransmitter release (such as norepinephrine and dopamine), promotes mitochondrial function, and modulates insulin signaling. 
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    Neurotrophins BDNF and NT-3 are reduced in PD. This is problematic, as neurotrophins increase neuronal survival and growth. Their depletion in PD likely contributes to progressive neurodegeneration (PN). Strategies aimed at increasing neurotrophin expression or activity, such as by supplementation do not hurt, are neuroprotective, and are reported to have noticeable positive effects.
                </p>
                
                
                <h4>Ischemic Mitigation</h4>
                <p>
                Citicoline prevents ischemia-induced tissue accumulation of free fatty acids and reduces infarct volume (a direct measurement of the extent of tissue death or necrosis caused by an ischemic stroke), and brain edema, thus resulting in an antiapoptotic effect that is related to the mitochondrial-dependent cell death mechanism.
                </p>
                
                
                <p>
                    Citicoline improves axonal transport deficits and supports axon regeneration. Axon regeneration is limited in adults, partly due to the reduced growth potential of mature neurons.
                </p>

                <h5>Uridine and CDP Choline</h5>
                <p>
                    CDP choline is involved in the synthesis of phosphatidylcholine and also serves as a precursor to both choline and uridine in the brain.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Uridine, a nucleotide base, can convert back to CDP-choline (Citicoline) and back again through a natural metabolic pathway.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The combination of uridine and CDP choline has been shown to have numerous benefits for brain health and cognitive function.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Uridine and CDP choline have been shown to enhance memory and learning by increasing the production of acetylcholine, a neurotransmitter involved in memory formation.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Uridine and CDP choline are each neuroprotective. Both increase phosphatidylcholine and improves the integrity of cell membranes. When combined, these effects are synergistic, leading to enhanced neuroprotection.
                </p>
                <p>
                   Uridine and CDP choline have been shown to improve cognitive function, including attention, focus, and processing speed.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Because Uridine increases CDP levels, it is necessary balance their co-supplemention.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Striking a balance between supplemental uridine and CDP choline is especially important for individuals taking carbidopa/levodopa.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Since uridine is a precursor to CDP choline, increasing uridine levels can potentially affect the balance of these two compounds in the body.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    UMP and CDP choline may have slightly different mechanisms of action and potential benefits. Some research suggests that CDP-choline may have more direct effects on acetylcholine levels in the brain, while UMP more directly effects dopamine levels.
                </p>
                <p>
                   No serious side effects have occurred in any series of patients treated with citicoline, which attests to the safety of treatment with citicoline.  Normally, the body tightly regulates these pathways but excessive supplementation is unnecessary and may lead to imbalances, especially in the later stages of the disease.
                </p>
                <h5>CDP Choline Supplementation</h5>
                <p>
                    500-1000mg CDP choline is generally very safe and well tolerated.
                </P>
                <p>
                    The effects of CDP choline vary on individual bases and are affected by other supplements and medications being used, so the dose will need to be custom-tailored.

                <p>
                    A study on Parkinson’s Disease Research, Education, and Clinical Center at the Portland and Puget Sound Veteran Affairs (VA) Clinics performed an add-on study to a longitudinal study following neuropsychiatric function in persons with PD.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Researchers found higher plasma vitamin D was associated with better cognition and better mood in their sample of PD patients without dementia.
                </p>
                <p>
                    More is not always better! Too much vitamin D3 can disturb calcium levels. Ask your team to optimize your vitamin D3 levels with regular bloodwork and supplement accordingly. 4,000 IU per day is safe. The body stores D3 so if you miss a day, you can double up the next day.

                <h5>How B-12 helps Parkinson's Disease</h5>
                <p>
                    A study published in Cell Research, "Vitamin B12 modulates Parkinson’s disease LRRK2 kinase activity through allosteric regulation and confers neuroprotection" found that B-12 has multiple mechanisms related to LRRK2
                    expressions that protect dopaminergic neurons.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Vitamin B12 inhibits LRRK2 kinase activity. This protects dopaminergic neurons from toxicity induced by LRRK2 and its mutant form, LRRK2-G2019S. The effect was shown to deficits in dopamine transmission in LRRK2-PD mouse
                    models.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Vitamin B12 prevents LRRK2-G2019S-potentiated &alpha;-synuclein accumulation in dopaminergic neurons.

                </p>
                
                <p>
                    Vitamin E is fat-soluble, so it’s best taken with other fats, like DHA or coconut oil, and with other fat-soluble supplements. More is not better! Excessive intake can be harmful and it's OK to miss a dose.
                </p>
                
                <h5>Neuroprotective Effects</h5>
                
                <p>
                	Tocotrienols have been shown to improve learning impairment in elderly subjects. Tocotrienols have shown cytoprotective, neuroprotective, and improved behavior effects in murine PD models.
                </p>
                <p>
                	Tocotrienols reduce BBB permeability by modulating tight junction proteins and reducing oxidative and inflammatory damage to the BBB. This helps maintain its integrity, which is essential for protecting the brain.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                	Tocotrienols protect mitochondrial function by preserving mitochondrial membrane potential, enhancing ATP production, and reducing mitochondrial-generated reactive oxygen species (ROS). 
               </p>
               
               <p>
        			Tocotrienols inhibit lipid peroxidation more effectively than tocopherols due to their better incorporation into cell membranes.
               	</p>
                <p>
					They also prevent mitochondrial dysfunction, which is a common feature in many neurodegenerative diseases.
				</p>
				
                <h5>Supplementation and Safety</h5>
                <p>
                	High doses of vitamin E, particularly alpha-tocopherol, and especially the synthetic form, dl-alpha-tocopherol, are toxic.
                </p>
                <p>
                	Vitamin E can thin the blood. Individuals taking blood thinners with a history of stroke, hemorrhagic stroke, or bleeding in the brain should be cautious when taking vitamin E supplements.
                </p>
                <p>
                	Light supplementation of a blend of the four tocotrienols and four tocopherols provides benefits while avoiding these risks. Do not exceed the recommended dose. Overdosing is harmful, and it is better to err on the side of caution.

                <h3>NAD+ and its precursors NMN, NR, and Niacin</h3>

                <h3>Nicotinamide Adenine Dinucleotide (NAD+)</h3>
                <p>
                    NAD+ is a coenzyme involved in energy metabolism, DNA repair, and cell signaling.
                </p>

                <p>
                     NAD+ reduces oxidative stress (including in the brain). This promotes recovery on a cellular level and leads to better energy metabolism, neuroprotection, mitochondrial function, and DNA repair. 
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    NAD+ affects macrophages to reduce the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and increases the production of anti-inflammatory cytokines.
                </p>

                <p>
                    NAD+ promotes mitophogy, leading to mitogenesis. This promotes neuronal survival and function and decreases ROS. Lower ROS levels reduce oxidative stress, which can prevent the misfolding and aggregation α-synuclein.
                </p>
                
                <h4>Declining NAD+ Levels</h4>
                <p>
                    Declining NAD+ levels contribute to reduced mitochondrial function and impaired cellular energy metabolism in neurons, making them more susceptible to oxidative damage and degeneration, particularly in PD, necessitating intervention.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Raising NAD levels (through injection, precursor supplementation, and upregulation via exercise) improves mitochondrial function and count in neuronal cells. This explains how it improves neurotransmission, synaptic plasticity, and improved motor symptoms.
                </p>
                <p>
                    NAD+ is essential for mitochondrial function which is significant in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease.
                </p>
                <h4>NAD Precursors</h4>
                <p>
                    Supplementation with NAD precursors NMN, NR, and niacin, increases cellular levels of NAD+ (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide). Among these, NMN appears to be the safest, best-tolerated, and most effective in increasing NAD+ production. This is because NMN converts to NAD+ more directly than the other precursors.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Niacin increases NAD+ levels, but through a different metabolic pathway than NMN and NR.

                        NMN is directly converted to NAD+ and its supplementation increases NAD+ levels.
                    </p>
                     
                    <p>
                        Preclinical studies and some clinical trials have shown promising results regarding the potential benefits of NMN supplementation in Parkinson's disease.
                    </p>
                
                    <h4>Supplementation</h4>
                    <p>
                        A typical dose of NMN is about 1g per day. It's safe and effective at much higher levels, as shown in human studies and rodent models. The only downside with higher doses is the cost. 
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Long-term NMN supplementation at lower doses has shown increased NAD+ levels, improved insulin sensitivity, enhanced mitochondrial function, anti-aging effects, and cardiovascular health.

                <h4>Senolytics</h4>
                <p>
                    Senolytics are used to selectively induce the death of senescent cells. Senolytic means "senescent cell destruction".
                </p>
                <p>
                    In PD, &alpha;-synuclein and especially its mutant forms damage mitochondria, causing a leak of sirtuins from the inner membrane of the mitochondria leading to mitochondrial failure and eventual cell failure.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Aggregates of &alpha;-synuclein form Lewy bodies inside the cell and block T-cells from activating the lysosome of non-functioning "zombie" cells.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Senolytics help prevent the formation of &alpha;-synuclein aggregates. This has numerous benefits, including neuroprotection, decreased neuroinflammation, improved mitochondrial function, neurogenesis, and autophagy.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Senolytics reduce the formation of Lewy bodies and facilitate T-cell activation of the lysosome in senescent cells by preventing obstruction by  &alpha;-synuclein aggregates
                </p>
            
                <p>
                    If senolytics can effectively enhance the immune response against alpha-synuclein aggregates, they may offer a disease-modifying treatment approach for Parkinson's disease. By targeting the underlying pathology of alpha-synuclein aggregation and promoting its clearance, senolytics could potentially slow or halt disease progression.

                    <h5>Overview</h5>
                    <p>
                        Urolithin-A is a naturally occurring compound produced by gut bacteria through the transformation of polyphenols, such as ellagitannins and ellagic acid, found in small amounts of some foods like wild berries (pomegranates, etc), walnuts, and tea. Urolithin-A supplementation stimulates mitophagy and mitochondrial function in several tissues.
                    </p>
                    
                    <h5>Benefits</h5>
                    <p>
                        Urolithin-A-induced mitophagy leads to mitogenesis. This promotes neuronal survival and function, making Urolithin-A strongly neuroprotective.
                    </p>
                    
                    <h5>Mitophagy</h5>
                    <p>
                        Mitophagy is a cellular process that recycles and removes damaged or unhealthy mitochondria, leading to their replacement with new, healthy mitochondria. Urolithin-A modulates the PINK1-Parkin pathway, autophagosome formation, and AMPK-SIRT1 activation.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        When PINK1 enters healthy mitochondria, the mitochondria removes it. However, when the mitochondria is damaged, PINK1 accumulates on the outer membrane. This signals the recruitment of Parkin to the outer membrane, which marks the damaged mitochondria for recognition by autophagosomes. The autophagosomes engulf the damaged mitochondria and transport them to the cell's lysosome for degradation. This process, known as <dfn>mitophagy</dfn>, signals the cell to initiate  <dfn>mitochondrial biogenesis</dfn>, restoring cellular energy and function.
                    </p>
                    
                    <h5>Mitophagy in Parkinson's Disease</h5>
                    <p>
                        In PD, there is an abnormally higher number of damaged mitochondria. Damaged mitochondria accumulate alpha-synuclein and contribute to the formation of Lewy bodies. Inducing mitophagy helps clear these harmful mitochondria and restore cellular energy production. This process protects against dopaminergic neurodegeneration.

                        1000mg per day of Urolithin-A is safe and well-tolerated in humans.

                        Urolithin-A is fat-soluble and can cross the BBB. Taking with food or other fat-soluble vitamins may improve absorption.

                    <h6>Food Sources</h6>
                        Pomegranates contain ellagitannins, convertible to urolithin A by gut bacteria in 30% to 50% of people. Optimistically, eating 1 pomegranate might yield a negligible 2 milligrams of Urolithin-A.                  
                    
                    <h5>Side Effects</h5>

                        Potential unknown side effects might include gastric upset or potential interactions with certain medications that also undergo hepatic metabolism.  Taking with food may help.
