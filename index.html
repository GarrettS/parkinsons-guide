		<p>
			This guide is crafted to empower individuals with Parkinson's Disease (PD) to optimize their health using the latest scientific evidence. It covers disease etiology, medication, exercise performance, diet and supplementation, care providers, photobiomodulation, and more, offering practical strategies for effective management and enhanced well-being.
		</p>
		<p>
			Started in 2021, this guide was inspired by a relative with PD who chose to eschew evidence-based strategies rather than investigate their veracity and incorporate them into her program. Her condition deteriorated due to complications of autonomic nervous system (ANS) failure, with severe gastrointestinal and heart problems. This guide reflects core principles of volition, self-ownership, evidence-based practice, informed decision-making, first principles, and critical thinking, aimed at helping others make proactive, informed choices to improve their health outcomes.

        <h2>Introduction to Parkinson's Disease</h2>

        <p>
            Parkinson’s Disease (PD) is a progressive neurological condition caused by the aggregation of the pre-synaptic peptide α-synuclein. This causes loss of dopaminergic neurons, leading to progressive neurodegeneration (PN) characterized by motor and non-motor symptoms.
        </p>

        <!--
        <p>
            Alpha-synuclein aggregates in the midbrain and damages neurons, including the autonomic nuclei, also located also throughout the body, which are responsible for autonomic functions (blood pressure, heart rate, GI system, etc).
        </p>
        <p>
            Progressive neurodegeneration ensues and is exacerbated by unilateral neurological modulation of the dopaminergic pathway (the L-Dopa / DDC inhibitors, aka "standard of care") and is more pronounced in later stages.
        </p>

        <p>
            Parkinson's Disease affects various brain regions, including the substantia nigra, basal ganglia, cerebral cortex, thalamus, hippocampus, cerebellum, and other regions involved in motor control, cognition, movement and the nervous systems.
        </p>
        -->
        <!-- p>
            The nervous system comprises the Central Nervous System (CNS), Peripheral Nervous System (PNS), and autonomic nervous system (ANS). The CNS, consisting of the brain and spinal cord, processes information and coordinates responses. The PNS connects the CNS to the body, relaying sensory input and motor output. The ANS regulates involuntary functions like heart rate and digestion.
        </p -->
        <p>
            PD primarily affects the Central Nervous System (CNS), particularly dopamine-producing neurons, leading to motor symptoms like tremors and rigidity. However, dysfunction of the autonomic nervous system (ANS) becomes more noticeably pronounced in the later stages, contributing to non-motor symptoms such as <abbr title="Gastrointestinal">GI</abbr> issues, low blood pressure, and urinary dysfunction.
        </p>
        <p>
            PD-related autonomic dysfunction can exacerbate renal issues, leading to a complex interplay of factors that contribute to orthostatic hypotension in PD.

            <h3>Causes and Risk Factors</h3>
            <p>
                Parkinson's Disease is a neurological condition resulting from the pathology of alpha-synuclein (α-synuclein), (α-synucleinopathy). 
                <span class="call-out">Understanding the role and effects of α-synuclein in PD is important to mitigating the disease's progression.</span>
            </p>
            <p>
                Overexpression of &alpha;-synuclein leads to its aggregation and formation into oligomers (peptides) and fibrils (see image). Oligomers of &alpha;-synuclein can form Lewy bodies, abnormal aggregations that develop inside nerve cells.
            </p>

            </figure>
            <p>
                Alpha-synuclein is abundant primarily in the brain, especially in the neocortex, hippocampus, and substantia nigra (SN). Smaller amounts are found in the heart, muscles, and other tissues. It is transported into and out of the
                brain by the blood-brain barrier. <cite class="reflink"><a href="#yu-ting-sui">Y. Sui</a></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
                Six mutations of &alpha;-synuclein are currently associated with familial parkinsonism. Mutant &alpha;-synuclein forms aggregates more readily than wild-type (normal) &alpha;-synuclein. <cite class="reflink"><a href="#v-c-ruf">V. Ruf</a>, <a href="#jie-li">J. Li</a></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
                Wild-type &alpha;-synuclein can be removed by lysosomes. Mutant forms of α-synuclein resist degradation and inhibit the degradation of other substrates.
            </p>
            <p>
               &alpha;-synuclein oligomers, as well as other &alpha;-synuclein variants, disrupt mitochondrial function. The oligomers prevent autophagy by blocking lysosomal degradation, disrupting membrane homeostasis (they poke holes in the cell), inhibiting endoplasmic reticulum (ER) function and synapses (connections between neurons), and causing inflammation that further damages cellular function. 
            </p>
        
            <!-- TODO: Where does this go??
            <h4>SNCA Gene Encodes Alpha-synuclein</h4>
            <p>
                The SNCA gene encodes &alpha;-synuclein. In the brain, &alpha;-synuclein is found mainly at the tips of nerve cells (neurons) in specialized structures called presynaptic terminals.
            </p>
            <p>Mutations in the SNCA gene lead to mutant &alpha;-synuclein.</p>
            <h4>
                Autosomal Dominant Parkinson's Disease, PARK1
            </h4>
            <p>
                PARK1 is an inherited, dominant genetic trait (autosomal dominant) in PD that causes heterozygous triplication of the SNCA gene.
            </p>
            <h4>LRRK2</h4>
            <p>
                Leucine-Rich Repeat Kinase 2 (LRRK2) is an enzyme encoded by a gene of the same name (the LRRK2 gene).
            </p>
            <p>
                LRRK2 mutations are implicated in PD pathogenesis and may influence &alpha;-synuclein metabolism and neuronal function.
            </p>
            <h5>LRRK2-G2019S</h5>
            <p>
                LRRK2-G2019S is a mutant form of LRRK2 found in PD. LRRK2-G20195 causes &alpha;-synuclein accumulation in dopaminergic neurons. &alpha;-synuclein accumulation leads to all of the problems previously mentioned,
                including &alpha;-synuclein oligomers and fibrils.
            </p>
            <p>
                LRRK2 mutants in genetic PD cause shortening and simplification of the dendritic tree in vivo and in cultured neurons.
            </p>
            <p>
                LRRK2 inhibitors can improve Parkinson's disease by reducing &alpha;-synuclein.
            </p>
            <h4>PINK1</h4>
            <p>
                PTEN-induced kinase 1 (PINK1) is a kinase produced by the PINK1 gene. Mutations in the PINK1 gene are a rare cause of one form of autosomal recessive early-onset Parkinson's disease that may be more associated with
                mitophagy, a process by which damaged or dysfunctional mitochondria are removed, reducing oxidative stress and inflammation.
            </p>
            <h4>Current Therapies in Clinical Trials of Parkinson’s Disease: A 2021 Update</h4>
            <p>
                The complex pathology is partially depicted in the figure below

                    <p>
                        (A) The pathological hallmarks of Parkinson’s disease include dopaminergic neuronal death, &alpha;-synuclein aggregates, mitochondrial dysfunction, reactive oxygen species, apoptosis, and neuroinﬂammation.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        (B) PD is a multifactorial disorder involving aging, genetics, and environmental factors, associated with dopaminergic neuronal death. Gene mutations associated with PD include DJ-1, PTEN-induced putative kinase-1 (PINK1), parkin, leucine-rich repeat kinase-2 (LRRK2), Synuclein alpha (SNAC), and ubiquitin carboxyl-terminal hydrolase-L1 (UCHL1). 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Neurotoxins (e.g., rotenone, paraquat) and gene mutations of DJ-1,  PINK1, parkin, LRRK2, and SNAC, induce mitochondria complex I inhibition, ATP depletion, reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation, mitochondria depolarization, and mitochondrial dysfunction in dopaminergic neurons to promote neuronal death in the substantia nigra of PD patients.
                    </p><cite class="reflink"><a href="[F. Pan-Montojo]">F. Pan-Montojo</a></cite>
                    <p>
                        Overexpression of the SNCA gene can lead to the accumulation of  &alpha;-synuclein in the brain, which, if &alpha;-synuclein is of a mutant form can cause problems and contribute to the formation of Lewy bodies. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The UCHL1 gene and the overexpression of the SNCA gene are related in that UCHL1 is involved in the degradation of &alpha;-synuclein, a protein that is overexpressed in PD. 
                    <p>
                        The UCHL1 gene and the SNCA gene are both involved in PD pathogenesis.
                        UCHL1 gene mutations impair ubiquitin-proteasome systems and further induce autophagy lysosomal pathway dysfunction, contributing to Lewy body formation in dopaminergic neurons.

                The diagram offers some visual depiction of PD, with small mistakes.
            </p>
            <p>The authors miscall the &alpha;-synuclein gene, SNCA, "SNAC". Most of what they categorize as genetic is epigenetic. That is, attributable to a combination of genetic <em>and</em> environmental factors.</p>
            <p>
                Lewy bodies are comprised of &alpha;-synuclein fibrils, the manifestation of which can be partly affected by environmental factors. Lewy bodies appear in the “Genetic factors" group below &alpha;-synuclein.
            </p>
            <p>
                &alpha;-synuclein increase is not solely attributable to genetics but to a variety of epigenetic factors that can be affected.
            </p>

                In PD, aging, environmental hazards, and genetics interact pathologically. The pathological hallmarks of PD include dopaminergic neuronal death, &alpha;-synuclein aggregates, mitochondrial dysfunction, reactive oxygen species (ROS), apoptosis, and neuroinﬂammation. These problems, along with aging, genetics, and environmental factors, contribute to the disease progression. <cite class="reflink"><a href="#k-burton">K. Burton</a></cite>

                Mitochondrial dysfunction more significantly contributes to senescence than SATB1 inhibition. In fact, it is one of the primary causal factors of disease progression. Solutions to mitochondrial dysfunction are addressed with respective proportion herein. 
            </p>


            <h4>The Role of Pesticides</h4> 
            <p>
                Pesticide and herbicide exposure causes mitochondrial dysfunction and, in certain individuals, &alpha;-synuclein overexpression. Herbicide rotenone and pesticide paraquat so reliably induce PD that they are used to induce PD in rodent model experiments. <cite class="reflink"><a href="#jae-hyeon-park">jae-hyeon-park</a>, <a href="#f-pan-montojo">F.

            <h3>Testing and Diagnosis</h3>
            
            <p>
            Upon clinical diagnosis of PD (via <abbr title="Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale">UPDRS</abbr> score), serious damage has already been done to nerve cells of the substantia nigra. This underscores the importance of early testing and genetic testing. <cite class="reflink"><a href="#f-nouri-emamzadeh">F. Nouri Emamzadeh</a></cite>
            </p>

            <p>
                Alpha-synuclein oligomers are higher in PD patients than in healthy subjects. This can be tested with AlphaSyn-SAA salivary test or Syn-One skin biopsy.
            </p>
            <h3>Early Testing and Diagnosis with AlphaSyn-SAA</h3>
            <p>
                The AlphaSyn-SAA salivary test measures the levels of salivary alpha-amylase (SAA). The results are used to assess autonomic nervous system activity, particularly sympathetic nervous system activation. This test can, with some margin of error, identify people at risk of developing Parkinson’s disease <em>up to ten years</em> before symptoms appear. 
            </p>
            <h3>Syn-One</h3>
            <p>
                The Syn-One skin biopsy detects the presence of phosphorylated alpha-synuclein in the skin. This is a much more accurate test than the AlphaSyn-SAA and is usually used as confirmation, rather than a preventive diagnostic.

                <h4>Genetic Testing</h4>
                <p>
                    Most cases of Parkinson's Disease are not classified as genetic. Genetic testing for PD is not routinely performed because only about 15% of cases are determined to be genetic. It's a classic <dfn>absence of evidence</dfn> fallacy.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Genetic testing for PD can help better inform and guide its treatment.
                    Genes associated with PD may have varying effects on disease progression. (See also: <a href="https://www.michaeljfox.org/what-know-about-genetic-testing"

                <p>
                    All genetic types should be considered for the proposed treatments, with the focus and approach varying depending on the genetic mutation and its associated molecular pathway. Discussion of the genetic type and its associated treatments is recommended among the healthcare team.
                </p>
                <h5>Test Your Children</h5>
                <p>
                    Children of PD patients should be tested <em>before</em> they exhibit symptoms similar to those of PD. Symptoms may take up to 10 years to present. 
                </p>

                <h4>Genetic Treatment Approaches</h4>

                <p>
                    A custom-tailored care plan based on the genetic type of PD will predict the best outcomes.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Effective treatment must approach PD from multiple angles. The review <cite>"Current Therapies in Clinical Trials of Parkinson’s Disease: A 2021 Update"</cite>, provides a fair overview of PD.

            How to Build a Care Team
        </h2>
        <section id="care-team-introduction">
            <h3>Introduction</h3>

            <p>
                Optimizing health is complex, and a diagnosis with PD increases both the complexity and the need to overcome it. Conventional medicine generally fails to adequately address peripheral and autonomic nervous system (ANS) dysfunction, which typically manifests as GI issues, loss of bladder and bowel control, sleep problems, and ultimately, heart failure and death. 
            </p>
            <p>
				Seeking 'alternative' approaches without critical analysis is equally flawed. The only true alternative to effective treatment is ineffective treatment, and that raises the problem of determining efficacy.
            </p>
            <p>
				Many medical professionals 'conventional' or 'alternative', fall short, and trusting them them without questioning and verifying their recommendations leads may lead you to taking other medications, none of which improve health but instead hasten disease progression, down the aforementioned path of <abbr title="Progessive Neurodegeneration">PN</abbr>, <abbr title="autonomic nervous system">ANS</abbr> failure, and the inevitability of what follows. (For PD, these may include beta-3 agonists, anticholinergics, or fludrocortisones.) To add insult to injury, they might advise "mind, body, spirit" treatments that lack a clear mechanism of action or compelling evidence. 
            </p>
                        
            <p>
            	It is the patient's responsibility to audit his medical team. Start by consulting independent specialists, exploring reputable integrative medicine practices, and seeking out patient communities where you can find recommendations for doctors who prioritize a comprehensive approach. 
            </p>

            <p>
				The onus of responsibility to learn, assess claims, and take actions for your health is on you. This involves understanding the science behind treatments and engaging in self-advocacy to actively participate in the decision-making process. Skepticism isn't just healthy; it's fundamentally essential for survival and well-being.

            <h3>How to Interview Neurologists</h3>
            <p>
                Doctors are constrained by institutional protocols, which may limit their consideration of alternative treatment options.
             </p>
             <p>
                Assessing provider competence requires a more thorough approach than just checking credentials, affiliations, and years of experience.
            </p>
            <p>
                Approach the interview from a position of informed knowledge without revealing too much. When given the opportunity to speak freely, how do they err?
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The effectiveness of that strategy depends on one's knowledge and comprehension — specifically the depth and breadth of understanding and the ability to evaluate and scrutinize the accuracy of the interlocutor's information.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Better results are achieved by preparing detailed questions that delve into the neurologist's expertise in the specific area of concern.

                <h3>Tips for Selecting Providers</h3>
                <p>
                    Referrals can be initiated by a PCP, a neurologist, or a functional medicine specialist. The starting point is inconsequential; the objective is to assemble a comprehensive care team.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Some doctors are subject to protocols or guidelines established by their institution's medical board or regulatory bodies, and this can influence their treatment decisions. Seek a neurologist with the autonomy and openness to explore novel, evidence-based treatments beyond the standard of care.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Patient-centered care addressing root causes and individualized needs predicts the best results. Starting with a Functional and Integrative Medicine Specialist can be great. However, to avoid unqualified practitioners, it's essential to be well-informed.
                </p>
                <p>
                    During your initial consultation with a neurologist, discuss optimizing health to minimize <abbr title="Dopamine Replacement Therapy">DRT</abbr>.  Ask about specific treatments such as <a href="#hrt" title="hormone replacement therapy">HRT</a>, <a title="Photobiomodulation" href="#pbm">PBM</a>, and <a href="#5-htp">5-HTP</a>, and how they might interact with <abbr title="Dopamine Replacement Therapy">DRT</abbr>. If the doctor cannot explain their benefits or potential interactions, consider finding another doctor.
                </p>

            <h3>Symptomatic Approach</h3>
            <h5>Gold Standard: Dopamine Agonism</h5>
            <p class="call-out">
                The gold standard for managing PD is symptomatic management via dopamine agonism (<abbr title="Levodopa / Dopa-decarboxylase inhibitors">LD/DDC inhibitors</abbr>, MAO-B inhibitors, and <dfn title="catechol-O-methyltransferase">COMT</dfn> inhibitors). Unfortunately, that leads to other neurological imbalances, causes other nutrient deficiencies, and leads to PN.
            </p>
            <p>
                Maintaining dopamine levels in the brain helps alleviate motor problems and can reduce fibrillization. However, unilateral dopamine replacement therapy creates some problems discussed further herein.
            </p>
            <p>
                Some doctors may attempt to enhance dopamine function by suppressing the cholinergic system using anticholinergics, but this approach leads to adverse effects.

            <h4>Disease-Progression Approach</h4>
            <p>
                Doctors tend to discount the idea of slowing the progression of the disease. Some off-handedly discount supplements and nutrition as "complementary" care without examination. Many of these same doctors once prescribed anticholinergics. (If the doctor falls into that category, finding a new doctor may be advisable.)

        <section id="etiological-approach">
         <h3>Etiological Approach</h3>
         
        <p>
            Etiological treatments target the underlying causes of disease. These providers address the root causes with scientific rigor however, some may rely on conventional medicine and focus on the disease itself, rather than individual factors and health optimization.

        <section id="holistic-approach">
            <h3>Holistic Approach</h3>
            <p>
                The holistic approach is patient-centered care that aims to address the underlying causes of disease and promote overall health. However, some holistic providers use implausible or disproven strategies (e.g. homeopathy, reiki, "mind, body, spirit", etc).

    <!-- TODO: Move where??
            <h4>The Role of Nutrition</h4>
            <p>
                Nutritional deficiencies can exacerbate symptoms in individuals with PD and may sometimes be mistaken for progressive neurodegeneration. This misinterpretation can lead to inappropriate management strategies if the underlying nutritional issues are not addressed.
            </p>

                Furthermore, certain nutrient deficiencies can trigger cascading effects, exacerbating PD symptoms or hasten the decline of the condition. For example, deficiencies in vitamins B12, folate, and vitamin D have been implicated in PD and can affect neurological function and overall health. Inadequate intake of essential nutrients can also impair mitochondrial function, increase oxidative stress, and compromise neurotransmitter synthesis and signaling, all of which are implicated in PD pathophysiology.
            </p>
            <p>
                Additionally, levodopa/carbidopa therapy can reduce vitamin B6 levels, which is essential for the synthesis of neurotransmitters.
            </p>
            <p>
                It's crucial to build a comprehensive plan that strikes a balance between supplementation, nutrition, lifestyle, and regular monitoring to slow disease progression.
            </p>
            <p>
                Don't just "talk to your doctor", collaborate with a team of healthcare professionals with multiple specialties to create individualized treatment plans that include nutrition, lifestyle, supplementation, and medication. Regularly test and monitor status with symptoms and biochemical markers to assess the effectiveness of interventions and make adjustments as needed.

                <dfn>Antifibrillogenics</dfn> mitigate formation of α-synuclein fibrils. Anti-aggregants aim to prevent the accumulation of fibrils and other misfolded proteins into lewy bodies. By preventing the formation of α-synuclein fibrils and aggregates, these compounds address the underlying pathology of Parkinson's disease at a more fundamental level, potentially offering therapeutic benefits in managing the condition.

                Preventing fibril aggregation (<dfn>anti-aggregant</dfn>): These treatments focus on inhibiting the aggregation of α-synuclein fibrils into Lewy bodies, potentially slowing the spread of pathology and neurodegeneration.
            </p>
            <p>
                It is necessary to work with doctors who focus on what works. Focus on the facts and evidence, consider risk/reward, and work on total health. Avoid doctors who won't look at the evidence you present them.
            </p>
            
            <h4>What Do Doctors Miss?</h4>
            <p>
                Doctors typically prioritize symptoms over addressing the underlying causes. Specifically, they tend to focus on the dopamine pathway with medications like levodopa/carbidopa, to enhance dopamine levels in the brain, and COMT inhibitors, to inhibit its breakdown by catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT).
            </p>
            <p>
                Approaches to mitigating the underlying cause can extend longevity, improve quality of life, and reduce the dependence on medication which is not without side effects. Address these key areas for a more comprehensive approach to managing PD. (For solutions, see: <a href="#problem-list">Problem List</a>)

            <p>
                Many approaches overlap more than one problem area and have synergistic benefits. For example, 5-HTP is converted into serotonin in the brain. It inhibits the release of glutamate, mitigates oxidation modulates dopamine
                release, improves mitochondrial function, and improves sleep, which improves overall health, leading to a better sense of well-being and better exercise capacity and recovery.

            <h4>Standard of Care Medications</h4>
            <p class="call-out">
                Parkinson's disease is generally treated with symptomatic management. That includes:&mdash;
            </p>
            
            <ul>
                <li>Levodopa/Carbidopa (Dopamine Agonists)</li>

            </ul>
            <p>
                Levodopa/Carbidopa are dopamine agonists. COMT inhibitors prevent the breakdown of dopamine. Both classes of drugs exhibit dopaminergic side effects.
            </p>
            
            <h4>Criticism of Standard of Care</h4>
               
            <p>
				Standard of Care practices generally fall short in addressing the complexities of various medical conditions, including neurological disorders like PD.
			</p>
			
			<p>
				Medical schools and institutions often have long-standing traditions and biases toward conventional treatments. This bias is reinforced through outdated curricula, faculty influence, and institutional culture that prioritize traditional industry solutions over innovative approaches.
			</p>
			<p>
				Government policies and regulations often shape medical practice and can create conflicts of interest. For example, the FDA’s accelerated approval of Aduhelm in 2021, despite mixed trial results, was criticized due to concerns over industry influence and lobbying by Biogen
			</p>
			<p>
				Pharmaceutical funding creates conflicts of interest that permeate medical institutions. Students, often unaware of the bias, are encouraged to win teacher favor and earn good grades by adopting industry-supported ideologies while avoiding questioning the establishment or exploring other approaches.
			</p>
			<p>
				For example, the <a href="https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/ng71/chapter/Recommendations#pharmacological-management-of-motor-symptoms" target="_blank">NICE guidelines</a> recommend the use of anticholinergics for managing PD symptoms, despite their known negative effects on cognitive function, membrane integrity, and synaptic plasticity (for more, see: <a href="#cholinergics">cholinergics</a>). These recommendations highlight the broader issue of prioritizing pharmaceuticals over patient-centric care, pushing reliance on drugs and limiting opportunities for optimizing health beyond symptom management.
			</p>

			<h5>Anticholinergics</h5>
			<p>
				Standard of care recommendations include drugs that do not address underlying pathologies and may cause physical damage. Anticholinergics, such as Benztropine, are still recommended for managing symptoms like incontinence in PD, despite their well-established potential to impair cognitive function, affect neuronal transmission, and disrupt synaptic plasticity. The mechanisms behind their side effects, including memory problems and confusion, are well-documented. <cite class="reflink"><a href="#campbell">Campbell</a>, <a href="#yasumasa">Yasumasa</a></cite>
			</p>
			
			<p>
				While dopamine replacement therapy (DRT) is commonly used to manage motor symptoms, its overreliance can lead to long-term complications such as motor fluctuations and dyskinesias, which will be discussed further below. These examples highlight the limitations of standard treatment approaches and the need for strategies that address underlying pathologies, minimize harmful effects, and optimize health.
			</p>

			<h5>Supplementation</h5>
			<p>				
				Conversely, they oppose the use of over-the-counter supplements, specifically mentioning CoQ10, Vitamin E (unspecified form), and creatine — all of which have shown efficacy in neurodegenerative conditions, without prior consultation with a healthcare professional. Given that healthcare professionals are not trained in health optimization, such inquiries will likely result in denial of efficacy and refusal to look at evidence. This reflects a broader reluctance within the medical community of "not invented here" to eschew non-prescription treatments, often resulting in a dependency on conventional pharmaceuticals.
			</p>
			
			<p>
			Discouraging safe and potentially beneficial supplements while promoting anticholinergics reflects an incentive to maintain the status quo of pharmaceutical reliance and healthcare control over self-empowerment and patient health optimization.
			</p>
			
			<h5>Genetic Testing</h5>
			<p>
				Moreover, identifying PD gene mutations, especially in early-onset cases, can provide crucial information for prognosis and influence treatment decisions, particularly in cases initially suspected to be psychogenic. Despite this, genetic testing is not part of the standard of care.
			</p>

            <section id="dopamine-agonists">
                <h4>Dopamine Replacement Therapy &mdash; Overview</h4>
            
                <p>
                    Dopamine replacement therapy (DRT) for PD commonly includes levodopa/carbidopa (LD/DDC inhibitor) and MAO-B inhibitors. 
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    Replenishing dopamine levels in the brain helps alleviate motor symptoms such as tremors, rigidity, and bradykinesia (slowness, freezing), improving patients' quality of life. However, dopamine replacement therapy has other effects, good and bad.
                </p>
            
                <h4>Impact of Dopamine Agonists</h4>

                <h5>Fibrillization Inhibition</h5>
                <p>
                    Dopamine agonists inhibit fibrillization by reacting with the α-synuclein. This is an advantage, as fibrils contribute to cellular damage, senescent cells, and neurodegeneration. <cite class="reflink"><a href="#dorszewska">dorszewska</a></cite>
                </p>

                <h5>Problems</h5>
                <p>
                    Dopamine's antifibrillogenic effects are good but its interaction with α-synuclein also contributes to cellular damage and neurodegeneration. <cite class="reflink"><a href="#mor">mor</a>, <a href="#thompson">thompson</a></cite>
                </p>
                <p>
                   Dopaminergic modulation must therefore be carefully balanced to achieve optimal neuroprotection. Better neuroprotection and healthspan can be achieved through the multi-faceted approach described in the <a href="#treatment-plan">Treatment Starter Plan</a>. 
                </p>

                <h5>Neurochemical and Vitamin Imbalances</h5>
                <p>
                    Dopamine agonists also deplete active vitamin B6 levels in the body. They do this by irreversibly binding to and permanently deactivating pyridoxal 5’-phosphate (P5P), the active form of vitamin B6. This leads to various side effects and exacerbates the progression of the disease, as B6 is essential for dopamine synthesis and is involved in other metabolic pathways.
                </p>

                <h5>Progressive Neurodegeneration</h5>
                <p>
                    Dopamine is but one of many neurochemical systems in the midbrain. Focusing solely on the dopaminergic system without considering other neurotransmitter systems leads to progressive neurodegeneration (PN) exacerbating motor and non-motor symptoms.

                <p>
                    DRT should be used at the minimum effective dose (MED). This can be done using a holistic approach to address neuroprotection, neurorestoration, antioxidation, and mitochondrial health.

                <h4>COMT Inhibitors</h4>

                    COMT inhibitors are a class of medications that prolong the effect of levodopa by inhibiting the breakdown of dopamine in the brain. They work by blocking the action of the enzyme catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT), which breaks down catecholamines, including dopamine, norepinephrine, and epinephrine, resulting in sustained levels of these catecholamines.

                <p>
                    Tolcapone, a COMT inhibitor, has been associated with a higher risk of liver damage, which can be severe in some cases.

                <p>
                    Entacapone, another COMT inhibitor, has been linked to an increased risk of dyskinesias and other dopaminergic side effects.

                <h5>Early Menopause and PD</h5>
                <p>
                    Early menopause has been observed with statistical significance across women with PD. Postmenopausal HRT has been associated with a reduced PD risk in several studies. It has been repeatedly shown that more women without PD used postmenopausal estrogen compared with women with PD. The neuroprotective effects of estrogen replacement have shown positive results in animal models of PD, and in early menopausal women with PD. <cite class="reflink"><a href="#l-currie">L. Currie</a>, <a href="#d-brann">D. Brann</a></cite>
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    A 2023 study published in Alzheimer's Research & Therapy found HRT introduction is associated with improved delayed memory and larger entorhinal and amygdala volumes, but in <abbr title="Apolipoprotein E allele 4">APOE4</abbr> carriers only. APOE4 is associated with increased α-synuclein pathology in humans with PD. <cite class="reflink"><a href="#r-saleh">R. Saleh</a></cite>
                </p>
                <p>
                    A retrospective chart review of a computerized patient database was performed at Columbia-Presbyterian. The review included only women who had symptoms of presumed PD for less than 5 years and who had not yet been on L-dopa. This research found a positive association between estrogen use and lower symptom severity in women with early PD who were not yet taking L-dopa. This indicates that estrogen therapy may be beneficial for women with early PD who entered menopause early and have not yet started <abbr title="Dopamine Replacement Therapy">DRT</abbr>. <cite class="reflink"><a href="#r-pullman">R Saunders-Pullman</a></cite>
                </p>
                <p>
                     In a rodent model of PD, estrogen replacement reduced dopaminergic neuron loss, promoted maturation of <dfn title="the breakdown and degradation of cellular components by the cell itself">autophagy</dfn>, improved motor function and other symptoms, and slowed disease progression. <cite class="reflink"><a href="#x-li">X.Z. Li</a></cite>
                </p>
                <p>
                    The use of estrogen replacement in early menopausal women with PD is worth considering. <cite class="reflink"><a href="#m-borque">M. Borque</a></cite>

                <h5>Osteocalcin — Estrogen's Effects on Osteoblasts</h5>
                <p>
                    Estrogen stimulates osteoblasts, which produce osteocalcin (OCN). Some of that OCN is then carboxylated in a vitamin K-dependent process, resulting in carboxylated OCN and some is undercarboxylated OCN (ucOCN). Carboxylated OCN improves bone strength.
                </p>
                <p>
                     Undercarboxylated OCN acts as a hormone in the body and brain. OCN crosses the blood-brain barrier and has been shown to reach the midbrain and brainstem and influence brain functions such as memory and cognition. <cite class="reflink"><a href="#obri">A. Obri</a></cite>
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    The reduction in osteocalcin production during menopause, including uncarboxylated osteocalcin, can lead to decreased neuroprotection and cognitive functions.
                </p>
                
                <h5>Risks of HRT in Women</h5>
                <p>
                    The risks of estrogen replacement therapy include vascular disease and stimulation of estrogen-responsive cancer, and should not be taken without measured risk and medical supervision. Alternatives to increasing osteocalcin levels include high-impact and weight-bearing exercise, and supplementation of vitamin K, magnesium, strontium, collagen, sleep, and vitamin D.

                <p>
                    Testosterone is also neuroprotective, and 5-10% of it converts to estradiol via aromatase. Thus, <abbr title="Testosterone Replacement Therapy">TRT</abbr> can be used in men to raise testosterone to <em>optimal</em> levels (~800 ng/dL), resulting in a greater amount of aromatization to estradiol. <cite class="reflink"><a

                <h5 class="neuroprotective">Dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA)</h5>
                <p>
                    Dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) is a hormone produced by the adrenal glands, the ovaries, and the brain. It is a precursor to estrogen and testosterone and is converted into estrogen and testosterone in peripheral tissues.
                </p>
                <p>
                    DHEA is also involved in the regulation of sleep, memory, and cholesterol levels.
                </p>
                <p>
                    DHEA may help protect against the progression of PD. This is due to its ability to modulate memory formation, regulate neuronal activity, and enhance or restore memory and learning processes.
                </p>
                <p>
                DHEA can signal osteoblasts both directly and via its metabolites, such as estradiol (E2) and dihydrotestosterone (DHT). It also signals chondrocytes through these metabolites. Additionally, the blood-brain axis, facilitated by osteoblast stimulation, may be a mechanism through which DHEA enhances cognitive function. <cite class="reflink"><a href="#d-kirby">D. Kirby</a></cite>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Like pregnenolone, DHEA is fat-soluble, which allows it to cross the BBB relatively easily, and is available as a dietary supplement. The recommended dosage is 100mg ED.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A study found that DHEA administration alone improved the mean Parkinsonian score (<abbr title="Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale">UPDRS</abbr>) in moderately and severely impaired MPTP monkeys, a model of Parkinson’s disease. <cite class="reflink"><a href="#">D. Kirby</a></cite>
                </p>
                <p>
                    A 2006 Cochrane study found no current evidence for an improvement in memory or other aspects of cognitive function of non‐demented older people following DHEA supplements. However, a 2016 review found a positive correlation between DHEA-S blood levels and global cognition in both women and men. Other positive correlations between DHEA-S and working memory, attention, and verbal fluency were found only in women. DHEA's effects being more pronounced in women than in men may be due to its potential ability to ameliorate menopausal cognitive decline. <cite class="reflink"><a href="#j-evans">J.

            <h4>Pregnenolone</h4>
            <p>
                Pregnenolone is a neurosteroid and precursor to various hormones, including cortisol, DHEA, and progesterone. Pregenolone reduces levodopa-induced dyskinesias (LIDs) without compromising L-DOPA's motor benefits.
            </p>
            <h5>Pregnenolone Dosage</h5>
            <p>
                Pregnenolone is available as a dietary supplement and is typically safe in doses ranging from 10 to 50 mg per day.
            </p>
            <p>
                Pregnenolone is fat-soluble and crosses the BBB. Once in the brain, pregnenolone can be converted into other neurosteroids, such as allopregnanolone, which have various effects on neuronal function and behavior.
            </p>                
            <p>
                Several clinical studies have investigated pregnenolone as a treatment for Parkinson’s disease. One study found that pregnenolone dose-dependently countered L-DOPA-induced dyskinesias (LIDs) without affecting L-DOPA-induced motor improvements.

            <h3>Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS)</h3>
            <p>
                Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS) uses electrodes implanted in the brain to deliver electrical impulses to the globus pallidus internus (GPi). This helps to regulate brain activity.
            </p>
            
            <h4>LRRK2-G2019S and DBS</h4>
            <p>
                <abbr title='Leucine-Rich Repeat Kinase 2 gene with a glycine to serine substitution at position 2019'>LRRK2-G2019S</abbr> mutations tend to have relatively good outcomes with DBS compared to other genetic types. 
            </p>
            
            <p>
                DBS of the (GPi) primarily targets the GABAergic output neurons of the basal ganglia, influencing motor output and reducing motor symptoms in PD. However, the therapeutic effects of GPi stimulation in PD extend beyond
                modulating GABAergic transmission within the basal ganglia circuitry and can indirectly impact cortical glutamatergic <em>input</em> to the basal ganglia.
            </p>
            <p>
                While GPi stimulation primarily targets the GABAergic output of the basal ganglia, the dopaminergic system a core problem in PD pathology and treatment. Dopamine depletion in the basal ganglia is a hallmark feature of
                PD and leads to motor symptoms such as bradykinesia, tremors, and rigidity, and DBS helps treat these problems.
            </p>
            <p>
                Other neurotransmitter systems affected by DBS include the serotonergic, cholinergic, noradrenergic, and glutamatergic systems. Due to the delicate balance between all these systems stimulation of the entire GPi can more
                easily achieve a positive, balanced effect, compared to medication and supplementation with l-dopa/carbidopa and supplements like 5-HTP and GABA.
            </p>
            <p>
                This normalizes basal ganglion activity resulting in reduced excitotoxicity, better neuronal function, and greater cell longevity.
            </p>
            <p>
                Medication alone leads to PN. DBS reduces the need for medication, thus mitigating PN. Supplementation further reduces the need for medication, and thus PN. A team of specialists to craft a program with DBS, medication,
                and supplementation may offer the best possible outcome with the least PN and greater longevity.
            </p>
            <p>
                Crafting a personalized treatment program that incorporates DBS, medication, and supplementation requires the expertise of a multidisciplinary team of specialists, including neurologists, movement disorder specialists,
                neurosurgeons, pharmacists, dietitians, and other healthcare professionals. This team can collaborate to tailor treatment to the individual patient's needs, optimize therapy, and minimize PN.

            <h3>Exercise</h3>
            
            <h4>Physiological Response in the Brain</h4>
            <p>
             <abbr title="High intensity interval training">HIIT</abbr>, more than any other type of exercise, has been shown to fight neurodegeneration. It simultaneously stimulates multiple pathways and increases cerebral blood flow. Moderate and lower intensity cardiovascular exercise. "Zone 3" and "Zone 2" respectively, and active recovery provide supplementary benefits. <cite class="reflink"><a href="#lenhart">Lenhart</a>, <a href="#s-e-lucas">S.E. Lucas</a></cite>
            </p>
            
            <p>
                <abbr title="High-Intensity Interval Training">HIIT</abbr>, high-intensity cardiovascular training, resistance training, and endurance training are respectively the most effective at increasing neurotrophins such as <abbr title="Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor">BDNF</abbr>, <abbr title="Nerve Growth Factor">NGF</abbr>, <abbr title="Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor">VEGF</abbr>, <abbr title="Glial Line-Derived Neurotrophic Factor">GDNF</abbr>, <abbr title="Fibroblast Growth Factor 2">FGF2</abbr>, and <abbr title="Neurotrophin-3">NT-3</abbr>. These neurotrophins help protect neurons and glial cells.
            </p>
            <p>
              Higher-intensity exercise increases the production of neuropeptides (<abbr title="Neuropeptide Y">NPY</abbr>, <dfn title="Substance P — neuropeptide involved in various physiological processes.">Substance P</dfn>, Enkephalins) and signaling hormones (<abbr title="Insulin-like Growth Factor 1">IGF-1</abbr>, <abbr title="vascular endothelial growth factor">VEGF</abbr>, Cortisol). These effects enhance autophagy, mitochondrial function, and reduce neural apoptosis. Additionally, they improve ischemic conditions, mitigate oxidative stress, and boost insulin sensitivity and glucose uptake, leading to lower blood glucose and improved sleep.
            </p>
            
            <h4>Lower-intensity Exercise (Zone 2)</h4>   
            <p>			
				Lower intensity exercise, such as "Zone 2", is moderately low intensity aerobic exercise, such as fast walking or hiking, that occurs just below the lactate threshold and can be sustained for a long period without strain or heavy breathing. Although low-intensity exercise may not boost neurotrophic factors as acutely as high-intensity workouts, it supports overall brain health and helps maintain a baseline level of these factors for improved endurance, enhanced recovery, increased mitochondrial production, and reduced overtraining, making it an excellent addition to any fitness routine.
            </p>
            
            <h4>Proprioceptive Activities</h4>
            <p>
				Complex motor activities that require significant proprioception, such as dancing, have been shown to be beneficial and may increase blood flow to the midbrain. Further research is needed to clarify their precise effects on <abbr title="Glial Line-Derived Neurotrophic Factor">GDNF</abbr>. <cite class="reflink"><a href="#baudet">Baudet</a>, <a href="#aman">Aman</a></cite>
            </p>
           
            <h4>Peak Performance</h4>
            <p>
            	Increasing exercise intensity, VO<sub>2</sub> max, duration, and frequency leads to greater benefits. Contrary to the "minimum effective dose" approach in medicine, with exercise, more is better. By pushing the limits of exercise tolerance through training modulation and recovery strategies, individuals can maximize their neurological health. 
            </p>
            
            <h4>Limits to Exercise</h4>
            <p>
                Intense exercise, while beneficial, is physically and mentally taxing, increasing Reactive Oxygen and Nitrogen Species (RONS) and creating metabolic waste. To maximize the benefits of exercise, incorporate active recovery strategies such as mobility work, supplementation, and red light therapy to enhance exercise tolerance.
            </p>
            
            <h4>Supplementation and Recovery</h4>
            <p>
                Timing supplementation around exercise is beneficial as it enhances nutrient delivery to the brain due to increased cerebral blood flow. Pre- and intra-workout supplementation can boost performance, while post-workout supplementation aids in recovery and improves subsequent performance. Protein intake immediately after exercise can increase satiety and reduce energy intake, which helps regulate blood glucose levels. <cite class="reflink"><a href="#querido">Querido</a>, <a href="#clayton">D. Clayton</a>, <a href="#monteyne">A. Monteyne</a></cite>
            </p>
            
            <p>
                For example, <a href="#creatine">creatine monohydrate supplementation</a> increases brain creatine levels. During stress or trauma, such as intense exercise, creatine helps reduce oxidative DNA damage and restores normal brain and body creatine levels.
            </p>
            <h4>Types of Exercise</h4>
            <p>
                The categories of exercise that elicit a physiological effect on the brain include:
            </p>
            <dl>
            	<dt>HIIT  &mdash; High Intensity Interval Training
            	<dd> short periods of high-intensity effort, followed by brief periods of rest or low-intensity activity. This alternating pattern is repeated until exhaustion to maintain heart rate throughout the workout.
				</dd>
				
                <dt> HIT &mdash; High Intensity Training
                </dt>
                
                <dd> Targets strength training with high intensity and brief workouts. This improves cognitive function and brain health by increasing cerebral blood flow, <abbr title="Brain-derived Neurotrophic Factor">BDNF</abbr>, IGF-1, and osteocalcin. <cite class="reflink"><a href="#browne">Browne</a></cite>
                </dd>
                
                <dt>Zone 4 cardio</dt>
                <dd>High-intensity exercise zone,  80-90% of maximum heart rate (HRmax), Typically 2-10 minutes with a maximum sustained duration of around 15 minutes. Also known as "lactate threshold" or redline training.
                </dd>
                
                <dt> Zone 3 &mdash; Moderate-intensity cardiovascular training (70-80% of HRmax) 
                </dt>
                <dd> Enhances cerebral blood flow, metabolic, and cardiovascular health with a reduced risk of injury.
                </dd>               
                <dt> Zone 2 &mdash; Low-intensity cardiovascular training
                </dt>
                <dd>  Boosts aerobic endurance and promotes recovery with minimal injury risk.
                </dd>               
            </dl>

            <h4>Active Recovery</h4>
            <p>
                Active recovery elevates heart rate, enhancing blood flow to deliver nutrients and remove waste from tissues and hasten recovery. It can address mobility issues such as tight hips and a weak core or glutes, reducing injury risk.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Exercise increases brain blood flow, delivering oxygen and nutrients to brain cells. This triggers processes like neurogenesis, increased neurotransmitter production, and improved stress tolerance. Additionally, it boosts <abbr title="Brain-derived Neurotrophic Factor">BDNF</abbr>, promotes autophagy, reduces proinflammatory cytokines, and lowers blood sugar. These effects enhance memory, cognition, and mood, helping to counter neurodegeneration.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                This results in better memory and cognition and improved mood, countering or staving off neurodegeneration.
            </p>
            
            <h4>Mitochondrial Benefits</h4>
            <p>
                Regular exercise enhances NAD+ biosynthesis, activates AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and sirtuins, and stimulates mitochondrial biogenesis. It also promotes mitochondrial turnover and mitophagy, supporting healthy mitochondrial function.
            </p>
            
            <h4>Sample Exercise Plan</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Day 1: HIT + Zone 2 Cardio
                </li><li>Day 2: Zone 3 Cardio (40 min ergometer)
                </li><li>Day 3: HIIT + Active Recovery
                </li><li>Day 4: Zone 3 Cardio
                </li><li>Day 5: HIT + Zone 2 Cardio
                </li><li>Day 6: Zone 3 Cardio
                </li><li>Day 7: HIIT + Active Recovery
                </li>
            </ul>
            
            <h4>Summary</h4>
            <p>
            	Intense exercise counteracts neurodegeneration and enhances neurological health by increasing cerebral blood flow, promoting neurogenesis, boosting neurotransmitter production, and reducing inflammation. Different exercise types, including <abbr title="High intensity interval training">HIIT</abbr>, <abbr title="High intensity training">HIT</abbr>, Zone 3, Zone 2, offer distinct benefits. Balancing intense exercise with active recovery helps reduce injury and hasten recovery to improve exercise tolerance and maximize the results.

            <h3 class="neuroprotective">Photobiomodulation (PBM)</h3>
            <p>
                Photobiomodulation (PBM) is a non-invasive, low-risk treatment to improve cellular function. PBM can be done in clinics or independently, with consumer devices.

            <h4>Oxidative Stress and Inflammation</h4>
            <p>
            PBM inhibits hippocampal damage induced by oxidative stress and increases BDNF levels, making it suitable for treating nerve damage. <cite class="reflink"><a href="#j-c-heo">J.C. Heo</a></cite>
            </p>
            
            <h4>Ischemia and Blood Flow</h4>
             <p>
                PBM's anti-inflammatory effects mitigate inflammation from ischemic injury, reducing tissue damage and promoting healing. It increases local blood flow and oxygenation in ischemic tissues, alleviating hypoxia (low oxygen levels) and promoting tissue recovery.
            </p>
            <p>
                Ischemia can affect the delivery of therapeutic agents to the desired target in the midbrain. During ischemic events, blood flow to affected brain regions can be significantly compromised, limiting the delivery of oxygen, nutrients, and therapeutic compounds like cells (as mentioned elsewhere), melatonin, and anything crossing the BBB via passive diffusion. 
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Although numerous positive results have been observed in humans, depth penetration of the light waves is a concern. NIR light penetrates deeper than NIR, and coherent NIR (<abbr title="Light Amplification by Stimulated Emission of Radiation">laser</abbr>) even deeper. Cellular effects observed in rodents with NIR light can't be extrapolated to the much larger head thickness (and midbrain depth) of humans. <cite class="reflink"><a href="#y-lampl">Y. Lampl</a></cite>
            </p>
            <h4>Timing</h4>
            <p>
                The timing of PBM, in conjunction with the administration of substances like melatonin, may help improve delivery by mitigating the effects of ischemic inhibition on nutrient delivery to the midbrain.
            </p>

                Whole body irradiation with red light improves sleep quality. Used before sleep may offer better sleep effects. <cite class="reflink"><a href="#jiexiu-zhao">Jiexiu Zhao</a></cite>
            </p>

            <h4>Frequency</h4>
            <p>
                PBM in Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s disease models have necessitated repeated daily exposure to show beneficial results. In-home devices offer convenience, comfort, and affordability.
            </p>
            <p>
                Red light reaches the motor cortex, influences stem cell function, offers neuroprotection, restores functional activity, improves motor behaviors and reduces clinical signs, reduces <dfn title="Gliosos &mdash; when glial cells, CNS cells that support nerve cells, proliferate or hypertrophy in response to damage">gliosis</dfn>, and induces expression of trophic growth factors. 
                <cite class="reflink"><a href="#c-hamilton">C. Hamilton</a></cite>
            </p>
            
            <h4>Red Light on the Body</h4>
            <p>
                Parkinson’s disease kidney impairment happens from the start but becomes more of a problem during the later stages of the disease. Start early; don't wait.
            </p>
            <p>
                Red light improves renal function by improving renal blood flow and improving cell signaling in that area. PD impairs kidney function through &alpha;-synuclein aggregation accumulation and inflammation, autonomic nervous system (ANS) dysfunction, and dopamine depletion. Dopamine influences renal blood flow, blood pressure, and kidney function.
            </p>
            
            <h4>Near-Infrared (NIR) vs Red Light Therapy</h4>

            <p>
                Near-infrared (NIR) light has a deeper penetration depth than red light, allowing it to reach deeper tissues and organs, including the brain, without overstimulating the skin. <cite class="reflink"><a href="#t-a-henderson">T.A. Henderson</a></cite>
            </p>

            <p>
                Red light can be effective, too, but the longer duration and stronger intensity required for efficacy may overstimulate the skin. Homme LED devices that allow blending NIR and red frequencies should use lower intensity for the red frequencies to avoid burning or overstimulating the skin. This strategy can take advantage of their dermal benefits without damaging the skin while getting more intense NIR for the deep regions of the brain.
            </p>
            <p>
             Despite the large body of experimental and early clinical evidence, there is still much resistance to the use of photobiomodulation by patients and health professionals.

                    <p>
                        These data demonstrate that PBMT inhibits hippocampal damage induced by oxidative stress and increases the expression of BDNF in the hippocampus, a part of the brain used for learning and memory, located deep in the temporal lobe.

                    <p>
                        To examine the cellular process in the hippocampus, mice were used. Although the data are impressive, the problem with extrapolating data to humans is the size of the human head is much larger, thereby damping the intensity of the NIR waves as they aim toward the deep brain regions. A possible workaround is to direct the light towards the back, to target the CSF.

        <h4>Mixing and Storing Powders</h4>
        
        <p>The mixed powders "Mitochondrial Mix", "Cacao Mix", and "Post-Workout" powders must be made in batches and should be stored in a cool, dry place with a desiccant pack (like silica gel) inside the powder to prevent clumping and contamination (mold). Silica packs commonly shipped with raw powders and supplements can be reused.
        </p>
        
        <h4>Weighing and Mixing Powders</h4>
        <p>
            A sturdy gram scale or reliable, accurate food scale that measures to the nearest 0.01g (10mg) is necessary to ensure accuracy. To help ensure proper ingredient dispersal, mix the smaller ingredients first and blend in the larger ingredients.

			Food and Supplements
		</h3>
		
		<p>
			PD affects the central, peripheral, autonomic, and enteric nervous systems. Managing This requires a comprehensive approach that includes optimizing diet for enteric and metabolic health, nutrient timing with exercise, and addressing the <a href="#problems-list">mechanisms of various issues</a>. 
		</p>
		<p>
			Many foods not only interfere with the many complex pathologies of PD, but also can contribute to the development of neuroprotective agents against it. Many supplements are derived from food sources or need dietary fats for proper absorption. This section explores targeted dietary choices and supplements to optimize health and manage PD.
		</p>
		
		<section id="food">
			<h3>
				 Dietary Strategies for Parkinson's Disease
			</h3>
			<p>
				A custom-tailored diet for PD should consider gut health, blood sugar management, and bioactives to support disease management and overall health. 
			</p>
			<p>
				To manage blood glucose, eliminate all refined sugars, reduce starch intake, and include protein (especially post-workout). Use fats rich in medium-chain triglycerides (MCTs), such as coconut oil, as alternative energy sources for the brain and to enhance absorption of fat-soluble compounds (turmeric).
			</p>
			
			<h4>Eliminating Sugar</h4>
			<p>
				Gut health can be improved by diet. Eliminating refined sugars, especially fructose and sucrose is an important first step to improving gut health and blood glucose.
			</p>
			<p>
				 High dietary sugar can alter the gut microbiota, leading to endotoxemia (leaky gut), low-grade systemic inflammation, metabolic dysregulation, and cause numerous downstream deleterious health effects. <cite class="reflink"><a href="#satokari">R. Satokari</a></cite>
			</p>
			
			<h4>Probiotics, Fiber, and Polyphenols</h4>
			<p>
				 Including probiotics (such as fermented foods), prebiotic fibers like inulin and glucomannan, and polyphenols can increase satiety and boost the production of short-chain fatty acids and postbiotics. Inulin and glucomannan can be added to pre-, intra-, and post-workout drinks.
			</p>
			
			<p>
				 Polyphenols, fermentation byproducts, bioactive peptides, and organic acids enhance gut health and short-chain fatty acid (<abbr title="short-chain fatty acid">SCFA</abbr>) production through various mechanisms. These include prebiotic effects, direct probiotic actions, microbiota modulation, and the production of beneficial fermentation byproducts and organic acids. This synergistic effect supports a balanced gut microbiome, improves digestive health, and enhances overall well-being. <cite class="reflink"><a href="#x-wang">X. Wang</a></cite>
			</p>
			
			<h4>Polyphenols and SCFA</h4>
			<p class="tweet">
				<abbr title="short-chain fatty acid">SCFA</abbr>s are fatty acids with fewer than six carbons, produced by fermenting indigestible fibers in the gut. Polyphenols like <abbr title="Epigallocatechin gallate">EGCG</abbr> from green tea boost SCFA production, enhancing anti-inflammatory effects and colon barrier integrity, reducing enteritis. <cite class="reflink"><a href="#z-wu">Z. Wu</a></cite>
			</p>
			
			<p>
				SCFAs, including acetate, propionate, and butyrate, promote a healthier gut environment by supporting epithelial integrity and the growth of beneficial microbiota. This improvement helps regulate appetite and reduces cravings for carbohydrate-rich foods, especially fructose and sucrose. Better appetite regulation leads to improved blood glucose levels, enhanced insulin sensitivity, and reduced inflammation. Reduced inflammation, in turn, contributes to better metabolic health through improved insulin sensitivity and metabolic function, lowering the risk of metabolic syndrome, and supporting balanced hormonal regulation, mitigating disease progression. <cite class="reflink"><a href="#xiong">R. Xiong</a>, <a href="#c-de-luca">C. de Luca</a></cite>
			</p>
			<!--
			
			<h4>Post-workout Nutrition</h4>
			<p>
				The post-workout shake induces satiety, reducing food cravings to keep blood sugar low. Because exercise forces maximizes uptake of nutrients, bioactive compounds, and protein, and to induce satiety
			</p>
			
			<h4>Food and the Gut-Brain Axis in Parkinson's Disease</h4>
			
			<h5>Does Gut Dysbiosis Cause PD?</h5>
			
			<p>
				In a highly-cited 2003 study, H. Braak found that intestinal inflammation and gut microbiome alterations may precede the development of PD, supporting the idea that the gut is an initial site of pathological changes. <cite class="reflink"><a href="#h-braak">H. Braak</a></cite>
			</p>
			
			<p>
				Further observations that α‐synuclein was found in the enteric nervous system (ENS) of the vast majority of PD patients led to an increasing number of studies to investigate this phenomenon. However, the various methodologies between studies led to conflicting results. <cite class="reflink"><a href="#y-chao">Y. Chao</a></cite>
			</p>
			
			<p>
				Although the evidence supporting the hypothesis that synucleinopathy <em>begins</em> in the gut is inconsistent, problems in the gut-brain axis have been conclusively tied bidirectionally in PD. Mutation and aggregation of α-synuclein in the <abbr title="gastrointenstinal">GI</abbr> tract spreads via the vagus nerve to the CNS leading to dopaminergic neuron degeneration. <abbr title="Dopamine Replacement Therapy">DRT</abbr> leads to gut dysbiosis, further exacerbating the problem. <cite class="reflink"><a href="#y-chao">Y. Chao</a></cite>
			</p>
			
			<p>
				Fixing gut dysbiosis with probiotics and pre-biotics is an important step towards addressing GI function. In PD patients, this problem is more common and fixing it may help protect against neurodenegeration. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Recent research has explored the potential role of probiotics in managing PD symptoms, including constipation, endothelial health, and the gut-brain axis. <cite class="reflink"><a href="#s-romano">S. Romano</a>, <a href="#a-h-tan">A.H. Tan</a></cite>
			</p>

			<h4>Insulin Resistance (IR) in PD</h4>
			<p>
				According to a 2018 study, nearly 60% of non-diabetic PD patients may have undiagnosed insulin resistance, despite having normal blood sugar levels. And although higher body mass index (BMI) was associated with increased IR, even lean PD patients showed a higher percentage (41%) of IR compared to healthy adults without PD.
			</p>
			

Studies have consistently shown that individuals with PD exhibit alterations in their gut microbiome, characterized by reduced diversity and altered composition compared to healthy individuals. This dysbiosis may contribute to the development and progression of PD symptoms.

				Supplements
			</h3>
			<p>
				Supplements complement food and help manage PD by addressing specific <a href="#problems-list">mechanisms</a> involved in its progression. They also enhance exercise performance, aid in recovery, support better sleep, and improve overall health and well-being. An overview of each supplement, most of which have been personally experienced by the author, is provided following the legend below.
			</p>
	
			<h4>The Role of Nutrition</h4>
			<p>
				Nutritional deficiencies can exacerbate symptoms in individuals with PD and may sometimes be mistaken for progressive neurodegeneration. This misinterpretation can lead to inappropriate management strategies if the underlying nutritional issues are not addressed.
			</p>
			<p>
				Furthermore, certain nutrient deficiencies can trigger cascading effects, exacerbating PD symptoms or hastening PN. For example, deficiencies in vitamins B12, folate, and vitamin D have been implicated in PD and can affect neurological function and overall health. Inadequate intake of essential nutrients can also impair mitochondrial function, increase oxidative stress, and compromise neurotransmitter synthesis and signaling, all of which are implicated in PD pathophysiology.
			</p>
			
			<p>
				Additionally, LD/DDC inhibitor therapy can reduce vitamin B6 levels, which is essential for the synthesis of neurotransmitters.
			</p>
	
			<p>
				Don't just "talk to your doctor", your <a href="#care-team">multi-specialist team</a> must all work together on your individualized treatment plan that includes nutrition, lifestyle, supplementation, and medication. Regularly test and monitor status with symptoms and biochemical markers to assess the effectiveness of interventions and make adjustments as needed.
			</p>
			
			<p>
				Instead of "talking to your doctor", the development of an individualized treatment plan involves a multi-specialist team collaborating on nutrition, lifestyle, supplementation, medication, and regular testing and monitoring of symptoms and biochemical markers to assess and adjust interventions.

			<p>
				<dfn>Antifibrillogenics</dfn> mitigate the formation of α-synuclein fibrils. Anti-aggregants aim to prevent the accumulation of fibrils and other misfolded proteins in Lewy bodies. By preventing the formation of α-synuclein fibrils and aggregates, these compounds address the underlying pathology of Parkinson's disease at a more fundamental level.
			</p>
			<p>
				Preventing fibril aggregation (<dfn>anti-aggregant</dfn>): These treatments focus on inhibiting the aggregation of α-synuclein fibrils into Lewy bodies, potentially slowing the spread of pathology and neurodegeneration.
			</p>
			<p>
				Doctors who prioritize effective treatments should be favored, and those who dismiss claims without examination avoided. Focus should be placed on facts and evidence, risk versus reward, and health optimization.

				<h4>Creatine and Energy Production</h4>
				<p>
					Creatine increases mitochondrial ATP production, provides antioxidant effects, and reduces oxidative stress and mitochondrial damage. which helps it protect against neuronal damage and prevent cell death. <cite class="reflink"><a href="#c-rae">C. Rae</a>, <a href="#a-c-passaquin">A.C. Passaquin</a>, <a href="#h-arazi">H. Arazi</a></cite>
				</p>
				
				<h4>Creatine and Exercise</h4>
				<p>
					Creatine improves muscular strength, exercise recovery, mitochondrial function, and provides antioxidant effects. Because exercise plays a fundamental role in health optimization, creatine should be used with exercise to improve its performance and hasten recovery. <cite class="reflink"><a href="#h-chang">H. Chang</a></cite>
				</p>
				
				<h4>Cellular Mechanism of Action</h4>
				<p>
					Mitochondria produce energy through two different but connected pathways, the citric acid cycle and the electron transport chain (ETC). Creatine helps in this process by aiding energy production in the citric acid cycle.
				</p>
				
				<p>
					ATP (adenosine triphosphate) is the primary energy source for cells, but it can't be stored in large amounts and depletes quickly during high energy demands. When creatine monohydrate enters the cell, mitochondria convert it into creatine phosphate (CP). CP acts as a phosphate reserve, for regenerating ATP from ADP in the citric acid cycle, thereby maintaining ATP production and reducing the immediate burden on the <abbr title="electron transport chain">ETC</abbr>.
				</p>
				<p>
					The citric acid cycle uses acetyl-CoA and water, reducing <abbr title="Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (oxidized)">NAD+</abbr> to <abbr title="Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide Hydrogen (reduced)">NADH</abbr>, and releasing CO<sub>2</sub>. NADH then goes to the <abbr title="electron transport chain">ETC</abbr> to produce more ATP, the cell's main energy source. By rapidly replenishing ATP, <abbr title="Creatine Phosphate">CP</abbr> helps maintain cellular energy levels and supports neuronal function, which is impacted in PD.
				</p>
				
				<h5>Creatine as Cellular Energy for Synapses</h5>
				
				<p>
					Neuronal synapses are extremely energy-intensive. The release of neurotransmitters from the presynaptic neuron requires energy provided by ATP. Creatine inside neurons holds onto phosphate molecules, just like it does is skeletal muscle cells. Creatine can donate a phosphate to ADP to create ATP which can then be used to create more energy.
				</p>
				
				<p>
					The human brain burns more glucose than other organs in the body. Although it accounts for only about 2% of the body’s total mass, the human brain uses about 20% of the body’s total energy expenditure! 
				</p>
				
				<p>
					Creatine supplementation increases brain creatine levels. During stress or trauma, such as intense exercise, creatine supplementation improves oxidative DNA injury and normalizes brain and body creatine levels. <cite class="reflink"><a href="#s-forbes">S. Forbes</a></cite>
				</p>
	
				<p>
					A 2023 review study published in Sports Medicine found long-term high-dosage creatine supplementation increases brain creatine stores, improves cognition and memory, especially in older adults or during times of metabolic stress (e.g. sleep deprivation), improves aspects of recovery from traumatic brain injury in children, and has the potential to reduce symptoms of depression and anxiety. <cite class="reflink"><a href="#d-candow">D. Candow</a></cite>
				</p>
				
				<h4>Creatine and PD</h4>
				
				<p>
					Creatine has shown neuroprotection in PD patients with cognitive decline via creatine transporter uptake. In a rodent model, high-dosage creatine was shown to exert anti-inflammatory, antioxidative, and anti-aggregant effects on α-synucleinopathy. <cite class="reflink"><a href="#y-leem">Y. Leem</a></cite> <cite class="reflink"><a href="#h-chang">H. Chang</a></cite>
				</p>
				
				<p>
					A long-term, multicenter, double-blind, parallel-group, placebo-controlled, 1:1 randomized efficacy trial for 10g of creatine in PD patients showed benefit to the <abbr title="Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale">UPDRS</abbr> both at 1 year and at 18 months, but eventually terminated early with no determined harm or benefit. <cite class="reflink"><a href="#k-kieburtz">K. Kieburtz</a></cite>
				</p>
				
				<p>
					These results are not entirely disappointing. The study could have been better designed to determine a positive effect. The patients were not reported to be performing intense exercise, although some may have.
				</p>
					
				<p>
					<abbr title="High Intensity Interval Training">HIIT</abbr> exercise significantly mitigates and may partially reverse progressive neurodegeneration. However, high-intensity exercise also depletes brain creatine, which impacts neurological function. 
				</p>
				<p>             
					Had the patients in this study been assigned to a <abbr title="High Intensity Interval Training">HIIT</abbr> regimen, they would have benefitted from the exercise. HIIT depletes creatine levels and may deplete brain creatine levels. Creatine supplementation might result in less exercise-induced depletion of creatine, less oxidative damage caused by the exercise, and better exercise recovery (allowing for more frequent training). Such a design might have revealed a more significant benefit to the 10g ED creatine supplementation. However, despite the study's design, beneficial effects were observed at 1 year and at 18 months. <cite class="reflink"><a href="#b-laat">B. Laat</a></cite>
				</p>
				
				
				<h4>Supplementation</h4>
				
				<p>
					Taking creatine with food improves absorption. Eating increases the production of insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1), which helps facilitate creatine uptake. Because dosages recommended for neurological function tend to be much higher, in excess of 20g per day, those with impaired kidney function might consider a more moderate dose as a compromise. 
				</p>
				 
				<h4>Safety and Efficacy</h4>
				<p>
					Creatine is commonly used with minimal adverse effects reported in clinical studies.
				</p>
				<p>
					Creatine supplementation alone may not significantly slow the progression of Parkinson's disease, especially not in the later stages. But its neuroprotective and antioxidant effects contribute to overall disease management when used as part of a comprehensive treatment approach, particularly in combination with exercise, to stave off disease progression in the early stages of the disease. Because creatine helps with exercise recovery, its use allows for more frequent training to enjoy the benefits of exercise.

				<h4>Raw Cacao</h4>
				
				<ul class="treatment-rating">
					<li>Mechanisms: Neuroprotective, anti-ischemic, antioxidant, anti-inflammatory
					<li>Dose: 7g ED ☀️
					<li>Fat-soluble: ✅ (Theobromine, caffeine, and flavonoids are somewhat fat-soluble. The Fatty Acids and Phytosterols are very fat-soluble)
					<li>🩸🧠BBB: ✅
					<li>Safety: 9/10 (70% σ)
					<li>Efficacy:2/10 (40% σ)
				</ul>
				
				<p>
					Raw cacao is made from cold-pressed, unroasted cocoa beans, which preserves the nutritional content, in contrast to cocoa, which is heavily processed, roasted at high temperatures, and often has added sugar. 
				</p>
				
				<h4>Health Benefits</h4>
				<p>
					Cacao's flavonoids improve blood flow, lower blood pressure, and reduce heart disease risk. Increased brain blood flow and theobromine noticeably improve cognitive function. Anandamide in cacao helps regulate mood and alleviate depression. Flavonoids reduce chronic inflammation and overall disease risk. Additionally, cacao provides magnesium, manganese, and phosphorus for bone health, and about 20% fiber to support digestion and satiety.
				</p>
				
				<h4>Cognitive Benefits</h4>
				<p>
					Studies on raw cacao show cognitive improvement in healthy individuals of various ages. A 2024 single-blind study from Japan examined the cognitive effects of high versus low polyphenol cacao. The high polyphenol group showed improvements in mental and physical fatigue, stress, boredom, sleepiness, motivation, healing, enjoyment, relaxation, concentration, and willingness after two sets of cognitive performance tests. <cite class="reflink"><a href="#r-lalonde">R. Lalonde</a>, <a href="#a-sasaki">A. Sasaki</a></cite>
				</p>
				
				<h4>Preparation</h4>
				<p>
					To maximize the health benefits of cacao, it should be consumed in its raw or minimally processed form, such as raw cacao paste or powder. Heat processing degrades beneficial flavonoids and other nutrients, reducing its overall nutritional value. Therefore, it is important to minimize heat exposure during preparation. Additionally, added sugar not only diminishes the potential health benefits but also contributes to the formation of advanced glycation end-products (AGEs), which are associated with aging and various chronic diseases. For optimal health, it's advisable to choose unsweetened, high-quality cacao products.
				</p>
				
				<p>
					Cacao powder contains fat-soluble compounds but can be dissolved in hot water as a beverage with fats like coconut oil added.
				</p>
				<h4>Stimulatory Effects</h4>
				<p>
					Cacao contains theobromine (dimethylxanthine), a stimulant similar to caffeine but less methylated. Both bind to adenosine receptors in the brain, increasing activity and alertness, and can interfere with sleep. Therefore, it is advisable to avoid consuming cacao later in the day.

				<h3>Cinnamon</h3>
				<ul class="treatment-rating">
					<li>Mechanisms: Neuroprotective, Antidiabetic
					<li>Dose: 4g ED
					<li>Fat-soluble: ✅ (cinnamaldehyde and eugenol are moderately fat-soluble)

					Cinnamon is a spice obtained from the inner bark of several species of trees. Ceylon cinnamon is preferred, as it contains no coumarin, a natural carcinogen. Cinnamon contains both water-soluble and fat-soluble compounds. Cinnamon's fat-soluble compounds include cinnamaldehyde and epicatechin and its water-soluble compounds include procyanidin type-A trimer, cinnamic acid, and various flavonoids. 
				</p>
				
				<h4>Antidiabetic Effects</h4>
				<p>
					Cinnamon exhibits anti-hyperglycemic properties, with the most significant effects observed in Ceylon cinnamon. These effects are species-specific.  <cite class="reflink"><a href="#n-j-hayward">N.J. Hayward</a></cite>
				</p>
				
				<p>
					It does this by mimicking insulin receptor kinase, increasing glucose uptake, and glycogen synthase activity, and increasing GLP-1 concentrations. <cite class="reflink"><a href="#n-kizilaslan">n-Kizilaslan</a>, <a href="#j-hlebowicz">J. Hlebowicz</a></cite>
				</p>
				
				<p>
					A 2006 randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind study an an aqueous solution of cinnamon found improvements on fasting blood glucose and systolic blood pressure, and improvements in body composition in men and women with the metabolic syndrome. <cite class="reflink"><a href="#ziegenfuss">T. Ziegenfuss</a></cite>
				</p>
				
				<h4>Neuroprotective Effects</h4>
				<p>
					Glucose metabolism is impaired in Parkinson's Disease (PD). Improved glucose response and blood glucose levels from cinnamon's antidiabetic effects may benefit PD patients. <cite class="reflink"><a href="#a-marques">A. Marques</a></cite>
				</p>
				<p>
					Ingested cinnamon metabolizes to sodium benzoate (NaB). Both cinnamon and NaB upregulate neuroprotective molecules (Parkin and DJ-1) and protect the nigrostriatum in a mouse model.  <cite class="reflink"><a href="#s-khasnavis">S. Khasnavis</a></cite>
				</p>
				
				<h4>Supplementation</h4>
				
				<p>
					Translating the mouse dosage of the Khasnavis to human dosage, using the study's 100 mg/kg to a 12x k-factor results in 1.2 g/kg. For a 50 lb human, this equates to 60 grams of cinnamon daily — an impractical amount. Consuming 3g daily is only 5% of the suggested dose, offering minimal neuroprotection. This small dose can be achieved by adding cinnamon to premixed powders such as the cacao mix, post-workout protein mix, and to golden milk. Consuming CinnulinPF can achieve more optimal levels. <cite class="reflink"><a href="#e-angelopoulou">D. Patel</a></cite>

					<p>
						Turmeric, a rhizome of the Curcuma longa plant, contains curcumin as its primary active compound. While curcumin is the most researched, other curcuminoids also offer health benefits. In this guide,the terms <em>curcumin</em> and <em>turmeric</em> are used interchangeably.
					</p>
					
					<p>
						Curcumin crosses the blood-brain barrier to reach deep brain structures, including the midbrain, where it directly exerts beneficial effects. 
					</p>
	
					<h4>How Turmeric Helps PD</h4>
					<p>
						Turmeric promotes neuroprotection and neurogenesis. <cite class="reflink"><a href="#s-mishra">S Mishra</a></cite>
					</p>
	
					<p>
						Curcumin inhibits α-synuclein aggregation by inhibiting oxidative stress, replenishing <abbr title="Glutathione">GSH</abbr> levels, and preventing glial-associated inflammatory response. By preventing misfolding and aggregation, curcumin inhibits fibril formations that damage neurons and lead to neurodegeneration. <cite class="reflink"><a href="#n-sharma">N. Sharma</a></cite> <cite class="reflink"><a href="#x-geng">X. Geng</a></cite>
					</p>
					
					<p>
						Curcumin rescues α-synuclein from aggregation by increasing its <dfn>reconfiguration rate</dfn>. α-synuclein is prone to aggregation because it misfolds and, subsequently, its reconfiguration rate is slow enough to expose hydrophobic residues on the same time scale that bimolecular association occurs. α-synuclein misfolding exposes hydrophobic regions of the protein that are normally hidden in the correctly folded protein. These exposed hydrophobic areas can then interact with similar regions on other proteins, leading to aggregation, and eventually forming Lewy bodies. Curcumin mitigates this problem by preventing the misfolding. <cite class="reflink"><a href="#b-ahmad">B. Ahmad</a></cite>
					</p>
					
					<h4>Supplementation (Eating Turmeric)</h4>
					<p>
						Turmeric is generally safe at 1-10 g daily. However, very high doses may cause stomach upset or kidney strain, while lower doses may not be effective. <cite class="reflink"><a href="#h-ghodsi">H. Ghodsi</a></cite>
					</p>
	
					<h4>Challenges with Curcumin Absorption</h4>
					<p>
						Curcumin pills are convenient but poorly absorbed and rapidly metabolized. To improve absorption, frequent turmeric consumption throughout the day with fatty foods, black pepper or long pepper, and phosphatidylserine, fixes these problems.
					</p>
				
					<h4>Self-Emulsifying Drug Delivery Systems SEDDS</h4>
					<p> 
						Self-Emulsifying Drug Delivery Systems (SEDDS) are lipid-based formulations that create emulsions to improve the oral bioavailability of lipophilic substances like curcumin. The increased bioavailability means that a greater effect can be achieved without increasing the dose, thereby reducing the risk of side effects from overconsumption.
					</p>
				
					<h4>Enhancing Absorption with Food</h4>
					<p>                         
						Turmeric is good in curries with coconut oil, eggs, and in the cacao mix, when blended with coconut oil or butter. Such food formulations offer better absorption, acting as a SEDDS. Turmeric can be added to other dishes, like soups, andor blended into warm milk as <dfn>"golden milk"</dfn> with saffron, cinnamon, and other spices, or mixed into mustard as a garnish. 
					</p>
					
					<p>
						Piperine and piper longumine, from black pepper and long pepper, respectively, also increase turmeric bioavailability, and the latter is also senolytic. <cite class="reflink"><a href="#k-kesarwani">K. Kesarwani</a></cite>
					</p>
					
					<h4>Safety Concerns</h4>
					
					<p>
						Turmeric thins the blood, which may increase the risk of bleeding, especially in individuals taking blood-thinning medications or those with bleeding disorders or who are planning surgery. It may interact with blood thinners, diabetes medications, and medications that reduce stomach acid production.
					</p>
					<p>
						Excessive turmeric intake (over 10 g per day) may cause gastrointestinal issues or increase the risk of kidney stone formation, especially in those prone to kidney stones or with a history of kidney problems.

					<li>Mechanisms: Neuroprotective, Antioxidant, Sleep</li>
					<li>Dose: ~30mg of Saffron (8-10 threads) 🍽️💤</li>
					<li>🩸🧠BBB: ✅ <cite class="reflink"><a href="#y-bian">Y. Bian</a></cite></li>

				<p>
					Saffron is a spice made from the red stigmas or "threads" of the Crocus flower used in South Asian and Middle Eastern medicine as an <dfn title="substance that induces menstrual flow, even if it is delayed or absent.">emmenagogue</dfn>, general tonic, aphrodisiac and nerve stimulant in low doses either in tea or in meals.
				</p>
				
				<p>
					Saffron has antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and neuroprotective effects. Scientific research shows its beneficial effects on improving mood and sleep, enhancing cognitive function, and supporting cardiovascular health. The primary active components, such as crocin and picrocrocin, are water-soluble, while safranal, responsible for saffron's aroma, is fat-soluble.
				</p>
				
				<h4>Sleep</h4>
				<p>
				A 28-day, parallel-group, double-blind <abbr title="randomized controlled trial">RCT</abbr> A 28-day, parallel-group, double-blind RCT recruited sixty-three healthy adults aged 18–70 with self-reported sleep problems were randomized to receive either saffron or a placebo. Results showed that saffron was associated with greater improvements in the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI), Restorative Sleep Questionnaire (RSQ), and the Pittsburgh Sleep Diary (PSD) and was well-tolerated with no reported adverse effects. <cite class="reflink"><a href="#a-lopresti">A. Lopretsi</a></cite>
				</p>
				
				<h4>Saffron in Neurodegenerative Disease</h4>
				
				<p>
					Saffron has been proven to alleviate the symptoms of AD and its effects on PD are of continuing research, particularly for its antidepressant and anxiolytic effects. <cite class="reflink"><a href="#y-bian">Y. Bian</a></cite>
				</p>
				<p>
					A 2024 review found that saffron's compounds inhibit neuroinflammation and excitotoxic pathways, modulate autophagy and apoptosis, attenuate oxidative damage, and activate defensive antioxidant enzymes, providing neuroprotection against neurodegenerative diseases. <cite class="reflink"><a href="#hamedani">S. G.-Hamedani</a></cite>
				</p>
				
				<p>
					A 2019 rodent model study found saffron had a neuroprotective
effect and could be recommended as a possible therapeutic agent to prevent neurotoxicity allied to heavy metals and related neurodegenerative disorders like PD. <cite class="reflink"><a href="#tamegart">L. Tamegart</a></cite>
				</p>
				
				<p>
					Saffron inhibits damage and inflammation to astrocytes, a type of glial cell, through multiple pathways. Its active compounds modulate oxidative stress, reduce pro-inflammatory cytokine production, and support the maintenance of cellular integrity, thereby protecting astrocytes from injury and dysfunction. <cite class="reflink"><a href="#maqbool">Maqbool</a></cite>
				</p>
				<p>
					Glial cells, and specifically astrocytes, support the function and survival of neurons. Astrocytes can release neurotransmitters, such as glutamate and ATP, which can influence neuronal activity.
				</p>
				<p>
					Glial scar formation is a common pathological feature in various central nervous system (CNS) diseases, including PD. In PD, the glial scars form around damaged dopaminergic neurons, blocking their repair.
				</p>

				<h4>Supplementation</h4>
				<p>
					Some of the compounds in saffron are fat-soluble, while others are water soluble. Saffron can be drunk with turmeric and cinnamon in golden milk. Excessive amounts may cause bloating and gas and gut microbiota may positively affect the gut-brain axis, therefore, it's a good idea to consume saffron with prepared food.

					Coconut Oil
				</h3>
				<ul class="treatment-rating">
					<li>Mechanisms: Neuroprotective, Antioxidant, Mitochondrial</li>
					<li>Dose: ~30 ml of Coconut Oil per day 🍽️ </li>
					<li>🩸🧠BBB: ✅ (coconut oil itself does not cross the BBB, but MCFAs do)</li>
					<li>Fat-soluble: ✅
					<li>Safety: 9/10 (95% σ)</li>
					<li>Efficacy: 6/10 (60% σ)</li>
				</ul>
				
				<p>
					Coconut oil is extracted from the meat of mature coconuts. It is high in saturated fats and commonly used in cooking and food preparations.
				</p>
				
				<p>
					Rich in lauric acid and <abbr title="medium-chain triglyceride">MCTs</abbr>, coconut oil supports heart health by increasing HDL and providing antimicrobial effects. Lauric acid, a 12-carbon variety, may contribute to its positive effects on HDL. <abbr title="medium-chain triglyceride">MCTs</abbr> boost energy and enhance metabolic health, which can improve brain function and aid conditions like AD, PD, and MS. Additionally, coconut oil supports fat loss, nutrient absorption, and gut health.
				</p>
				
				<h4>Metabolic Health Effects</h4>
				<p>
					A 2018 double-blind RCT investigated the effects of various vegetable oils, including coconut, safflower, chia, and soybean (placebo) oils, on obese women following a hypocaloric diet.
				</p>
				<p>
					The coconut oil group showed significant improvements in cardiovascular risk factors, including reduced abdominal adiposity, decreased waist circumference, decreased waist-to-height ratio, lower blood glucose and glycated hemoglobin levels, reduced body fat, and increased lean mass. <cite class="reflink"><a href="#oliveira-de-lira">Oliveira de Lira</a></cite>
				</p>
				
				<p>
					The increase in lean mass was likely due to MCTs, which provide quick energy, enhance exercise performance, and stimulate muscle growth without promoting fat storage. Maintaining or increasing lean mass supports metabolic health and cardiovascular outcomes. The quick energy boost also makes coconut oil a good pre-workout option.
				</p>
				
				<h4>Mitigating PD</h4>
				
				<p>A 2022 review study found that coconut oil improves PD through multiple pathways, mediating oxidative stress, neuroinflammation, mitochondrial dysfunction, apoptosis, and excitotoxicity in various in vitro and in vivo models. Dietary intake of coconut oil has also been associated with a reduced incidence of PD. During digestion, coconut oil is broken down into smaller molecules, such as ketone bodies (KBs). These KBs can cross the <abbr title="blood-brain barrier">BBB</abbr> and serve as an alternative energy source for the brain, making coconut oil a significant natural remedy for neurodegenerative conditions. <cite class="reflink"><a href="#deepika">deepika</a></cite>
				</p>
				
				<p>
					Coconut oil has been shown to reduce obesity, improve insulin resistance, and support metabolic health. These improvements can reduce inflammation, enhance mitochondrial function, and increase cerebral blood flow. These effects may help explain how coconut oil potentially benefits neurodegenerative disorders such as AD, PD, and MS. <cite class="reflink"><a href="#oliveira-de-lira">Oliveira de Lira</a>, <a href="#ibrahim">Ibrahim</a></cite>
				</p>
				
				<h4>Mitochondrial Effects</h4>
				<p>
					Although progressive damage to dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra is a primary etiological pathway in PD, mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress contribute substantially to its pathogenesis. Coconut oil's <abbr title="medium-chain triglyceride">MCTs</abbr> are metabolized into glycerol and medium-chain fatty acids, which support mitochondrial <abbr title="adenosine triphosphate">ATP</abbr> production and may enhance mitochondrial biogenesis. <cite class="reflink"><a href="#ying-wang">Ying Wang</a></cite>
				</p>

				<p>
					A 2020 rodent model study even showed that coconut oil helped neural function and mitigated the effects of L-dopa supplementation, lending its use as a potential strategy to reduce reliance on <abbr title="dopamine replacement therapy">DRT</abbr>. <cite class="reflink"><a href="#shehata">Shehata</a></cite>

					Matcha
				</h3>
				<ul class="treatment-rating">
					<li>Mechanisms: Neuroprotective, Antioxidant, Mitochondrial</li>
					<li>Dose: 2-5g</li>
					<li>🩸🧠BBB: (The concentrated L-theanine can bypass the BBB’s natural barriers and reach the brain, where it is believed to have a positive impact on sleep, focus, learning, and symptoms of anxiety.) </li>
					<li>Fat-soluble: ❌ </li>
					<li>Safety: 8/10 (85% σ)</li>
					<li>Efficacy: 5/10 (80% σ)</li>
				</ul>
				
				<p>
					Matcha is a finely ground Japanese green tea powder rich in bioactives, including lutein, vitamin K, and polyphenols, particularly catechins like epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG). EGCG exhibits potent antioxidant and neuroprotective effects that help mitigate oxidative stress, neuroinflammation, and neurodegeneration.
				</p>
				
				<h4>Cognitive Effects</h4>
				
				<p>
					A 2020 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial over 12 weeks on 15 men and 39 women found that Matcha improved cognitive function (<abbr title="Montreal Cognitive Assessment">MoCA</abbr> test), with the effects being more pronounced in women than in men, especially in the cognitive domain of language. Researchers speculated that this may be associated with physiological changes that accompany estrogen loss and menopause in elderly women, attributing the potential effects to matcha's EGCG, vitamin K, and lutein content. <cite class="reflink"><a href="#k-sakurai">Sakurai</a></cite>
				</p>
				
				<h4>Metabolic Effects</h4>
				<p>
					A 2017 review found that EGCG exhibited a wide range of therapeutic properties including anti-atherosclerosis, anti-diabetes, anti-inflammatory, and antioxidant effects. The reduction in plasma glucose and inflammatory markers and the inhibition of <abbr title="Reactive Oxygen Species">ROS</abbr> generation have multiple benefits to cardiopulmonary and neurological health. <cite class="reflink"><a href="#q-y-eng">Eng</a></cite>
				</p>
	
				<p>
					Low-dose EGCG and caffeine, two components of matcha, elicit substantial synergistic anti-obesity effects by improving gut microbiota and enhancing short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) production. The gut microbiota regulates obesity and metabolic disorders through various physiological pathways, including SCFAs and their receptors. These effects on the gut microbiota may help explain the metabolic and cognitive benefits associated with matcha consumption. <cite class="reflink"><a href="#zhu">Zhu</a></cite>
				</p>
				
				<h4>Anti-aggregant Effects</h4>
				<p>
					EGCG has been shown to inhibit the ability of preformed oligomers, such as oligomers of α-synuclein, to increase the permeability of vesicles (small, membrane-bound structures within cells that contain fluid and are enclosed by a lipid bilayer), which can lead to cell damage and induce cytotoxicity in rat brain cells. This in vitro and rodent model evidence warrants further investigation in humans. <cite class="reflink"><a href="#lorenzen">Lorenzen</a>, <a href="#y-xu">Xu</a></cite>
				</p>
				
				<h4>Ceremonial Grade Matcha</h4>
				<p>
					Ceremonial grade matcha is made from the youngest tea leaves with higher concentrations of chlorophyll and lower fluoride content compared to culinary grade matcha made from older leaves, which accumulate fluoride from the soil as they grow.
				</p>
				
				<h4>Fluoride and Oxalates Warning</h4>
				<p>
					Matcha also has moderate levels of oxalates with younger leaves having higher oxalate concentrations than older leaves. Oxalates can contribute to inflammation and kidney damage. Moderate amounts of quality ceremonial grade matcha are safe for drinking (10 g of matcha contains approximately 60 mg of oxalate). Those seeking a much higher dose of EGCG and lutein without the fluoride and oxalate can consider supplemental EGCG.
				</p>
				
				<h4>Matcha Preparation</h4>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Grade:</strong> Use ceremonial grade matcha for higher polyphenols and less caffeine and fluoride.</li>
    <li><strong>Timing:</strong> Consume in the morning or early afternoon to avoid nighttime caffeine effects.</li>
    <li><strong>Water Temperature:</strong> Heat water to 160–175°F (70–80°C; well below boiling) to preserve polyphenols.</li>
    <li><strong>Milk:</strong> Avoid milk to maintain polyphenol effectiveness.</li>
</ul>

					Ginseng
				</h3>
				<ul class="treatment-rating">
					<li>Mechanisms: Neuroprotective, Anti-inflammatory, Antioxidant, Mitochondrial</li>
					<li>Dose: 200 - 400 mg pre-workout ☀️</li>
					<li>🩸🧠BBB: ✅ Ginsenosides can cross the blood-brain barrier, but transport may be poor. <cite class="reflink"><a href="#y-n-zhao">Zhao</a></cite></li>
					<li>Safety: 8/10 (75% σ)</li>
					<li>Efficacy: 6/10 (60% σ)</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
					Ginseng is a traditional herbal medicine used for energy and vitality, metabolic (<abbr title="blood glucose">BG</abbr>) and cardiovascular health, stress relief, sexual dysfunction, and cancer protection. Its ginsenoside components, primarily Rb1 and Rg1, and saponins have shown neuroprotective effects, alleviating PD symptoms and slowing disease progression.
				</p>
								
				<h4>Ginseng in PD</h4>
				<p>
					Ginseng exhibits improved motor function and increased dopamine levels in PD models. These neuroprotective effects are explained by reduced oxidative stress, inflammation, and neuronal apoptosis, with no significant toxicity observed in most studies. <cite class="reflink"><a href="#he">He</a>, <a href="#l-song">Song</a>, <a href="#zaafan">Zaafan</a>, <a href="#van-kampen">van-kampen</a>, <a href="#jh-choi">Choi</a></cite>
				</p>
				
				<p>
					Ginsenoside Rb1 inhibits fibrillation, oligomerization, and toxicity of α-synuclein, and disaggregates preformed fibrils.  <cite class="reflink"><a href="#y-heng">Heng</a>, <a href="#ardah">Ardah</a></cite>
				</p>
				
				<h4>Supplementation</h4>
				<p>
					Ginseng's energizing effects make it suitable pre-workout or earlier in the day. Fermented ginseng offers significantly better absorption with higher ginsenoside concentration, compared to the low oral absorption of non-fermented ginsenosides (0.1 – 3.7%). <cite class="reflink"><a href="#j-ryu">Ryu</a></cite> Start with 200-400 mg daily, gradually increasing the dose as needed. Select a high-quality product with clear labeling.
				</p>
				
				<h4>Side Effects</h4>
				<p>
					Side effects may include a mildly elevated heart rate, increased blood pressure, as well as insomnia if consumed in the evening. Ginseng may enhance the activity of MAOIs, which could allow for reductions in medication dosage. Consult a healthcare professional for potential interactions and monitoring. <cite class="reflink"><a href="#l-liu">l-liu</a></cite>

				<h3>Acetyl-L-Carnitine (ALCAR)</h3>
				<ul class="treatment-rating">
					<li>Mechanisms: Neuroprotective, Antioxidant, Mitochondrial</li>
					<li>Dose: 1.5 - 2g pre-workout ☀️</li>
					<li>🩸🧠BBB: ✅ ALCAR can easily cross the blood-brain barrier, which allows it to target brain cells more effectively than free L-carnitine.<cite class="reflink"><a href="#akihiro-inano">akihiro-inano</a></cite></li>
					<li>Safety: 8/10 (75% σ)</li>
					<li>Efficacy: 6/10 (60% σ)</li>
				</ul>
				
				
				<p>
					Acetyl-L-Carnitine (ALCAR) is a modified form of L-Carnitine, an amino acid that transports fatty acids into the mitochondria for energy conversion, making it an excellent fat-burning supplement.
				</p>
				
				<h4>Blood-Brain Barrier</h4>
				<p>
					ALCAR’s acetyl group allows it to cross the blood-brain barrier more effectively than L-carnitine, enhancing brain energy metabolism and cognitive function.
				</p>
				
				<h4>How ALCAR Works</h4>
				<p>
					ALCAR facilitates the transport of fatty acids into mitochondria, boosting energy production and reducing oxidative stress. This helps boost brain energy and neurotransmitter activity. Therapeutic benefits may include improved cognitive function, potential support for depression, and reduced oxidative stress, and fat loss.
				</p>
				
				<h4>Performance and Recovery</h4>
				<p>
					Forms of l-carnitine, including ALCAR, improve exercise performance and recovery. A 2018 study published in the Journal of Exercise Nutrition and Biochemistry found that L-carnitine supplementation enhances exercise performance while attenuating blood lactate and oxidative stress responses to resistance training. <cite class="reflink"><a href="#koozehchian">Koozehchian</a></cite>
				</p>
				
				<p>
					A comprehensive 2018 review in Nutrients analyzed multiple studies across various populations, concluding that l-carnitine intake improves recovery after exercise, alleviates muscle injury, and reduces markers of cellular damage and free radical formation accompanied by attenuation of muscle soreness. Studies in older adults further showed that l-Carnitine supplementation can lead to increased muscle mass accompanied by a decrease in body weight and reduced physical and mental fatigue.
				</p>
				
				<h4>Metabolic Health</h4>
				<p>
					A 2021 review study investigated the effects of L-Carnitine, ALCAR, and Propionyl-L-Carnitine (PLCAR) on body mass in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) patients. After reviewing several studies, they concluded that 2 g/day l-carnitine for at least 2 weeks to affect body mass in T2DM patients, and no differentiating effects were found in acetyl-l-carnitine or propionyl-l-carnitine groups. <cite class="reflink"><a href="#dd-wang">Wang</a></cite>
				</p>
				
				<h4>Neurological Effects</h4>

				<p>
					ALCAR protects dopaminergic neurons by reducing neuroinflammation, apoptosis, astrogliosis (damage to  astrocytes (glial cells)), and oxidative stress. ALCAR has shown neuroprotective effects in rodent models of PD, both in vitro and in vivo, protecting cells against the accumulation of alpha-synuclein. <cite class="reflink"><a href="#s-a-majd">Majd</a>, <a href="#burks">S Burks</a></cite> 
				</p>
				<p>
					A 1990 study on PD patients showed that 2g of ALCAR improved the H-reflex and enhanced sleep architecture, including spindle activity, in non-placebo subjects.
				</p>
				<p>
					Researchers found that the 2 g of supplemental ALCAR improved the H-response, sleep stages, and spindling in test (non-placebo) subjects. The H-response, or Hoffmann reflex, is a muscle reflex response to specific nerve stimulation, characterized by distinct latency and amplitude. Spindling refers to brain wave activity occurring during <abbr title="Non-rapid eye movement sleep">NREM</abbr> sleep, particularly in stages N2 (lighter sleep) and N3 (deeper sleep). <cite class="reflink"><a href="#puca">Puca</a></cite>
				</p>
				
				<p>
					A later 2018 multicenter, randomized double-blind, placebo-controlled 28 day clinical trial studied the efficacy of 1500 mg ALCAR per day in patients with dementia-associated with cerebrovascular disease. Although the study excluded patients with PD, researchers found that 1.5g of ALCAR significantly improved cognitive assessment. <cite class="reflink"><a href="#ys-yang">ys-yang</a></cite>
				</p>
				
				<p>
					A 2022 randomized, observational, double-blind, placebo-controlled study on ALCAR scheduled prefrail elderly patients. 92 patients received 3 months of treatment with ALCAR at 1.5 grams or placebo, twice daily, and then 3 months of follow-up. They found that ALCAR treatment delayed the incidence and severity of onset of degenerative disorders of the elderly in prefrail subjects with improvement in memory and cognitive processes. <cite class="reflink"><a href="#malaguarnera">Malaguarnera</a></cite>
				</p>
				
				<p>
					ALCAR supports exercise performance and recovery, mitochondrial health, cognitive function, and fat loss. Cognitive function is improved in elderly and some cognitive function, likely due to its ability to aid mitochondrial energy production, which may have potential benefit for PD.
				</p>
				
				<h4>Supplementation</h4>
				<p>
					Taking 1.5 - 2 g ALCAR pre-workout enhances exercise performance. Intense exercise increases cerebral blood flow, potentially enhancing ALCAR uptake in the brain. It is avoid taking ALCAR before sleeping, as its stimulating effects may interfere with sleep.

				<h3>Alpha-Lipoic Acid (ALA)</h3>
				<ul class="treatment-rating">
					<li>Mechanisms: Neuroprotective, Antioxidant, Mitochondrial</li>
					<li>Dose:  250-500 mg ED ☀️</li>
					<li>🩸🧠BBB: ✅ ALCAR can easily cross the blood-brain barrier, which allows it to target brain cells more effectively than free L-carnitine.<cite class="reflink"><a href="#j-liu">J. Liu</a></cite></li>
					<li>Safety: 7/10 (75% σ)</li>
					<li>Efficacy: 6-7/10 (70% σ)</li>
				</ul>
	
				<p>
					Alpha-Lipoic Acid (ALA) improves mitochondrial function and reduces oxidative damage. <cite class="reflink"><a href="#j-liu">J. Liu</a></cite>
				</p>
				
				<h4>Supplement Forms: s- and r-Enantiomers, and Binding</h4>
	
				<p>
					Most research on ALA uses both s- and r-isoforms. The naturally occurring r-form has higher absorption and bioavailability than the synthetically produced s-form. <cite class="reflink"><a href="#b-salehi">B. Salehi</a></cite>
				</p>
				
				<h5>Na-r-ALA &mdash; Increased Absorption</h5>
				<p>
					Despite its advantages, free-form r-ALA is still prone to polymerization. Na-r-ALA (sodium-bound r-ALA) is comparatively more stable, less prone to polymerization, and has better absorption compared to free-form r-ALA. Lysine R-lipoate may offer greater absorption compared to r-ALA. <cite class="reflink"><a href="#d-a-carlson">D.A. Carlson</a></cite>
				</p>
	
				<h4>How R-ALA Works</h4>
				
				<p>
					R-ALA activates <abbr title="AMP-activated protein kinase">AMPK</abbr> which stimulates mitophagy. This leads to mitochondrial biogenesis and improved mitochondrial function. It increases glucose uptake and decreases glucose production in the liver, resulting in enhanced insulin sensitivity and reduced oxidative stress. <cite class="reflink"><a href="#y-wang">Y. Wang</a>, <a href="#w-j-lee">W. J. Lee</a></cite>
				</p>
				
				<h4>R-ALA in Parkinson's Disease</h4>
				<p>
					 Insulin resistance (IR) is commonly associated with an increased risk of developing Parkinson’s disease. IR leads to elevated brain glucose, which damages brain cells and accelerates neurodegeneration. <cite class="reflink"><a 
			 href="#e-hogg">E. Hogg</a></cite>
				</p>
				
				<h5>Iron in Parkinson's Disease</h5>
				<p>
					Alpha-synuclein pathology disrupts iron homeostasis in PD. High iron levels harm dopaminergic neurons, inducing cell death and leading to more severe motor deficits with mutant α-synuclein. <cite class="reflink"><a 
			 href="#f-jia">f-jia</a>, <a 
			 href="#p-lingor">p-lingor</a></cite>
				</p>
				
				<p>
					ALA's improvement to mitochondrial function and antioxidant status make ideal for PD. <cite class="reflink"><a href="#j-liu">J. Liu</a></cite>
				</p>
				<p>
					R-ALA decreases intracellular <abbr title="Reactive Oxygen Species">ROS</abbr> and iron levels. <cite class="reflink"><a 
			 href="#s-tai">S. Tai</a></cite>
				</p>
				
				<p>
					Overexpression of α-synuclein inhibits <abbr title="Adenosine 5′ Monophosphate-Activated Protein Kinase">AMPK</abbr> activity, contributing to the neurodegenerative process in PD. ALA increases AMPK, which improves mitochondrial function &mdash; a problem in PD. A rodent model experiment showed that treatment with acetyl-L-carnitine or α-lipoic acid improved motor performance, reduced oxidation, and improved ATP production. <cite class="reflink"><a href="#w-bobela">W. Bobela</a>, <a 
			 href="#s-zaitone">S. Zaitone</a>, <a href="#h-zhang">H. Zhang</a></cite>
				</p>
				
				<h4>Synergy: Na-r-ALA, Creatine, ALCAR, and Carbohydrates</h4>
				
				<p>
					R-ALA, an antioxidant, helps protect the mitochondria from damage, allowing them to function more efficiently. <cite class="reflink"><a 
			 href="#h-zhang">H. Zhang</a></cite>
				</p>
				<p>
					Combining ALCAR, r-ALA, and creatine amplify each other's effects, making this combination a potent pre-workout mitochondrial activator. <cite class="reflink"><a href="#d-g-burke">D.G. Burke</a></cite>
				</p>
				<h4>Side Effects</h4>
				<p>
					Gastrointestinal upset can occur. Some individuals experience this when taking Na-r-ALA on a full stomach, but not when taking r-ALA in the morning with water and fruit.

				<h3>GABA, 5-HTP, and Melatonin</h3>
				<p>
					GABA, 5-HTP, and melatonin can help PD patients through multiple neurological pathways. They're grouped because they all promote sleep and should all be taken at night.
				</p>
				<h4>Dopaminergic, Serotonergic, and GABAergic Systems</h4>
				<p>
					PD affects the dopaminergic, serotonergic, and GABAergic systems, which are interdependent. Doctors typically focus on the dopaminergic system, leading to imbalances in other systems, nutrient deficiencies, and progressive neurodegeneration (PN).
				</p>
				
				<p>
					Addressing only the dopaminergic system without considering the broader neurochemical landscape results in inadequate management of PD symptoms, exacerbates non-motor symptoms, and leads to treatment-related complications.
				</p>
	
				<h4>Comprehensive PD Management</h4>
				<p>
					A comprehensive approach to PD must consider not only the direct effects of medications but also their broader implications for nutritional status and metabolic function for improved outcomes and quality of life.
				</p>
				
				<h4>Medical Team Awareness</h4>
				<p>
					All medical team members must understand the broader implications of PD treatments to prevent nutrient depletion and exacerbation of neurodegeneration.
				</p>

					<h3>GABA</h3>
					<ul class="treatment-rating">
						<li>Mechanisms: Sleep, Dopaminergic side-effects
						<li>Dose: 1000mg 💤</li>
						<li>🩸🧠BBB: ❌
						<li>Safety: 7/10 (75% σ)
						<li>Efficacy: 6/10 (70% σ)
					</ul>
					<p>
						GABA is an inhibitory neurotransmitter that regulates dopaminergic neuron activity in the brain. 
					</p>
					
					<h4>GABA and Sleep</h4>
					<p>
						GABA supplementation improves sleep by interacting with neurotransmitter systems in both the enteric nervous system (ENS) of the gastrointestinal tract and peripheral nervous system (PNS) receptors in the brainstem. This interaction influences the vagus nerve, leading to relaxation and better sleep quality.
					</p>
	
					<h4>GABA and Dopaminergic Side Effects</h4>
					<p>
						In Parkinson’s disease, the loss of GABAergic neurons in the substantia nigra contributes to motor symptoms.
					</p>
	
					<p>
						Dyskinesia is a common side effect of long-term treatment with levodopa in Parkinson’s disease. GABA supplementation at 1000mg daily has the potential to help regulate dopamine release and likely ameliorate dyskinesia. 
					</p>
					
					<p>
						Non-pharmacological approaches, such as physical therapy and deep brain stimulation (DBS) targeting GABAergic circuits, may also help manage motor complications.

						Changes in serotonin signaling happen in the early stages of Parkinson's. It is imperative to work on this system as early as possible. Do not wait for GI symptoms to develop.
					</p>
					<p>
						Dopamine Replacement Therapy (DRT) commonly used to treat Parkinson’s can cause involuntary movements; <dfn>"L-DOPA-induced dyskinesia (LID)"</dfn>. 5-HTP supplementation helps balance and restore serotonin to reduce the severity of these symptoms by modulating serotonin levels and dopamine release.
					</p>
					
					<p>
						Parkinson's disease affects not only the dopaminergic system but also other neurotransmitter systems, including the serotonergic system, by the same mechanisms (mitochondrial dysfunction, aggregation, etc). This leads to progressive degeneration of serotonergic terminals associated with the ANS (Autonomic Nervous System), the development of non-motor symptoms, and complications like GI dysfunction, a common problem in PD, and may be related to visual hallucinations in some patients.
					</p>
					<p>
						DRT depletes vitamin B6 levels, essential for nerve health and neurotransmitter synthesis. This problem impacts nerves directly and <em>also</em> leads to multiple neurotransmitter systems failure, further damaging nerves (and with the unpleasant symptom of neuropathy) (B-12 causes neuropathy, too).
					</p>
					<p>
						Metabolic pathways involving neurotransmitters are complex. The complexities of these delicate interactions, as shown in the figure "Competitive Neurotransmitter Inhibitors", are well-handled in healthy individuals, but disrupted in PD and disrupted further by <abbr title="Dopamine Replacement Therapy">DRT</abbr>. <cite class="reflink"><a href="#a-munoz">a-munoz</a></cite> <cite class="reflink"><a href="#m-hinz">m-hinz</a></cite>
					</p>   
					
					<p>
						To elaborate, the aforementioned pathways include Dopamine, norepinephrine, epinephrine, glutathione, S-adenosylmethionine (SAMe), methionine, cysteine, tryptophan, serotonin, and vitamin B6 affect each other and contribute to neurological function, oxidative stress regulation, mood regulation, and overall health. 
					</p>
					<p>
						Minimizing <abbr title="Dopamine Replacement Therapy">DRT</abbr> and supporting other neurotransmitter systems avoids the impossible challenge of micromanaging every neurotransmitter pathway.
					</p>
					<p>
						Diet, supplementation, and regular monitoring must be balanced to slow disease progression.

					<h4>Melatonin</h4>
					<ul class="treatment-rating">
						<li>Mechanisms: Neuroprotective, Antioxidant, Anti-inflammatory, Mitochondrial, Anti-ischemic</li>
						<li>Dose: 10mg per day 💤 </li>
						<li>🩸🧠BBB: ✅</li>
						<li>Safety: 9/10 (90% σ)</li>
						<li>Efficacy: 8/10 (85% σ)</li>
					</ul>
					<p>
						Melatonin is a hormone produced by the pineal gland, a small endocrine gland located in the midbrain between the two hemispheres.
					</p>
				
					<h5>Neuroprotective</h5>
					<p>
						Melatonin protects neurons against oxidative stress, a problem exacerbated by Parkinson's Disease (PD) that leads to progressive neurodegeneration (PN). It interacts with nuclear receptors and signaling pathways to regulate gene transcription. This causes an increase in the production of superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione peroxidase, and glutathione reductase.
					</p>
					
					<p>
						 Neuroinflammation leads to increased ROS production. Increased ROS production contributes to neuronal damage which perpetuates further neuroinflammation. Melatonin reduces inflammation, thereby reducing oxidative stress.
					</p>
					
					<p>
						Melatonin directly scavenges free radicals, reducing the oxidative burden on cells and allowing antioxidant enzymes to function more efficiently.
					</p>
					<p>
						Melatonin receptors MT1 and MT2 in the substantia nigra are reduced in PD patients. Supplementing melatonin helps amend this deficit.
					</p>
	
					<p>
						Melatonin's neuroprotective effects, bolstered by its anti-inflammatory effects, may contribute to the preservation of MT1 and MT2 receptors and contribute to neuroprotection.
					</p>
	
					<h5>Vasodilation Effects</h5>
					<p>                
						Brain ischemia, a common problem in PD, occurs when blood flow and oxygen supply are restricted to various parts of the brain. Worse, ischemia to the substantia nigra exacerbates the problem of decreased dopamine output. This impairs mitochondrial function, leading to energy depletion and cell death.
					</p>
				
					<p>
						Melatonin has vasodilatory effects, relaxing blood vessels, and improving blood flow. This may help improve perfusion to ischemic brain regions, potentially reducing tissue damage and promoting recovery. 
					</p>

					<h5>Mitoprotective</h5>
					<p>
						Melatonin protects mitochondrial function and integrity, mitigating cellular damage caused by ischemia.
					</p>
					<h5>Supplementation</h5>
					<p>
						Melatonin is safe to take. Excessive doses over 10-15mg may cause next-day tiredness and headache.

					Mitochondrial Quinones (PQQ, CoQ10, K2) 
				</h3>
				
				<p>
					The three mitochondrial quinones are PQQ, CoQ10, and Menaquinone (MK-4 and MK7, also known as "vitamin k2"). These fat-soluble substances are <dfn>electron transporters</dfn> that help the mitochondria generate ATP, used for cellular energy. Their supplementation has shown health benefits, especially for athletic performance and when mitochondrial function is impaired, however they each serve more specific roles.
				</p>
				
				<p>
					These mitochondrial quinones promote mitochondrial biogenesis, improving ATP production, and reduce oxidative stress. Their combined supplementation has shown synergistic effects, improving mitochondrial efficiency, reducing fatigue, and enhancing overall cellular health.

					<h3>Pyrroloquinoline Quinone (PQQ)</h3>
					<ul class="treatment-rating">
						<li>Mechanisms: Antifibrillogenic, Anti-aggregant, Anti-ischemic, Mitochondrial, Neuroprotective, Antioxidant, Anti-inflammatory, Neurorestorative</li>
						<li>Dose: 40-200mg per day 🍽️ </li>
						<li>🩸🧠BBB: ❌ (?)</li>
						<li>Safety: 9/10 (90% σ)</li>
						<li>Efficacy: 8/10 (85% σ)</li>
					</ul>
	
					<p>
						Pyrroloquinoline Quinone (PQQ) is a naturally occurring coenzyme manufactured by bacteria, found in plants in tiny amounts, and utilized by mammalian cells as an important nutritional growth factor. PQQ is not produced endogenously in humans.
					</p>
	
					<p>
						PQQ activates the signaling pathway involving the transcription factor PGC-1α (peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1-alpha), which promotes the formation of new mitochondria. This increases the number and efficiency of mitochondria in cells, improving cellular energy production. <cite class="reflink"><a href="#w-chowanadisai">W. Chowanadisai</a>, <a href="#p-hwang">P. Hwang</a></cite>
					</p>
	
					<h4>Brain Health</h4>
					<p>
						Neurologically, PQQ increases blood flow to the cerebral cortex, protects against cell damage, promotes nerve growth factor (NGF) production, and prevents neurodegeneration caused by oxidative stress. These combined effects improve upon cognitive deficits from oxidative damage and senescence, and enhance memory, attention, cognition, learning, and mood. <cite class="reflink"><a href="#k-ohwada">K. Ohwada</a>, <a href="#k-shiojima">K. Shiojima</a>, <a href="#m-tamakoshi">M. Tamakoshi</a>, <a href="#k-ikemoto">K. Ikemoto</a></cite>
					</p>
					
					<h4>Cardiovascular Health</h4>
					<p>
						 By reducing oxidative stress and inflammation, PQQ supports endothelial function and protects against damage to blood vessels. PQQ has been shown to improve LDL levels, probably by the enzyme <abbr title="AMP-activated protein kinase">AMPk</abbr>, which regulates blood lipid levels, and to significantly decrease the levels of plasma C-reactive protein and <abbr title="interleukin 6">IL-6</abbr>. <cite class="reflink"><a href="#c-harris">C. Harris</a>, <a href="#m-nakano">M. Nakano</a>, <a href="#y-huang">Y. Huang</a></cite> 
					</p>
				
					<p>
						PQQ helps prevent the formation of &alpha;-synuclein fibrils in vitro. However, these antifibrillogenic effects in humans, from supplementation, are unproven and questionable, as PQQ's ability to cross the BBB has not been established. 
						<cite class="reflink"><a href="#m-kobayashi">M. Kobayashi</a>, <a href="#j-kim">J. Kim</a></cite> 
					</p>
					
					<h4>Blood-Brain Barrier (BBB)</h4>
					<p>
						PQQ's cognitive and neurological effects could be achieved either through indirect mechanisms, undetermined transport proteins might facilitate the passage of PQQ across the BBB, metabolites that can cross the BBB and exert beneficial effects on brain function, or a combination of things. 
					</p>
					<p> 
						PQQ's effects do involve enhanced systemic energy metabolism, reduced inflammation, increased antioxidant capacity, stimulation of neurotrophic factors, improved vascular health, and gut-brain axis modulation. These systemic effects create a more favorable environment for brain health, indirectly supporting cognitive function, whether or not PQQ itself crosses the BBB.
					</p>
					
					<h4>Supplementation</h4>
					<p>
						Although many studies show benefit at 20 or 30 mg, 40 &ndash; 200 mg per day of PQQ is safe. It is fat-soluble and best taken with other fat-soluble supplements and food.
					</p>
					<p>
						In 2017, the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) Panel on Dietetic Products determined a No Observed Adverse Effect Level (NOAEL) of 100mg/kg per day for 90 days. For a 50kg woman, this translates to a dose of 5g per day. Other studies have investigated PQQ's benefits and safety using similar dosages.
					</p>
					<p>
						Given the vast multitude of benefits that occur on the cellular level and the incredibly high safety threshold, a recommended dose of PQQ is 40 &ndash; 200mg per day. There are no known contraindications.  Dose-dependent effects have been observed in rodents with <abbr title="Traumatic Brain Injury">TBI</abbr>. It is recommended to start with a more moderate dose of 40 mg per day and gradually increase. <cite class="reflink"><a href="#l-zhang">L. Zhang</a></cite>
					</p>
					
					<h4>Side Effects</h4>
					<p>
						Mild headaches and insomnia may be experienced when PQQ is taken at night. Higher doses (e.g., 100-200 mg per day) are well-tolerated and may provide more pronounced effects.
					</p>

					<h3>Vitamin K2</h3>
					<ul class="treatment-rating">
						<li>Mechanisms: Mitochondrial, Neuroprotective, Antioxidant, Anti-inflammatory</li>
						<li>Dose: 2mg per day (2000 mcgs) 🍽️ </li>
						<li>🩸🧠BBB: ✅ </li>
						<li>Safety: 9/10 (90% σ)</li>
						<li>Efficacy: 6/10 (50% σ)</li>
					</ul>
					<p>
						Vitamin K2 supports mitochondrial function by activating sirtuin 1 (SIRT1), a longevity gene that regulates mitochondrial biogenesis and helps manage oxidative stress. However, K2's biggest role is its effects on bone metabolism and the bone-brain axis. <cite class="reflink"><a href="#d-simes">D. Simes</a></cite> 
					</p>
					
					
					<h4>Blood-Brain Barrier</h4>
					<p>
						Vitamin K2's ability to cross the blood-brain barrier enables it to exert its effects within the central nervous system, including reduced oxidative stress in neurons and reduced neuroinflammation. <cite class="reflink"><a href="#a-popescu">A. Popescu</a></cite>
					</p>
					
					<h4>Bone-Brain Axis</h4>
					<p>
						Osteocalcin is a protein produced by cells in bones called osteoblasts. 
					</p>
					<p>
						K2 carboxylates osteocalcin (OCN). Carboxylated OCN (cOCN) promotes deposition of minerals such as calcium and strontium in bones, resulting in improved bone mineral density and strength. 
					</p>
				
					<p>
						K2 also stimulates osteoblastogenesis, the production of new osteoblasts, and suppresses osteoclastogenesis, leading to an increase in osteocalcin production, which further contributes to overall bone health and osteocalcin levels. <cite class="reflink"><a href="#m-yamaguchi">M. Yamaguchi</a></cite>
					</p>
					
					<p>
						Osteocalcin promotes spatial learning and memory and prevent anxiety-like behavior. This complex interplay between the bones and the central nervous system, influencing each other’s function and behavior, is known as the <dfn>bone-brain axis</dfn>. <cite class="reflink"><a href="#a-obri">A. Obri</a></cite>
					</p>
					
					<h5>Brain Calcification</h5>
					<p>
						Calcium deposits in the basal ganglia can disrupt normal movement patterns, leading to symptoms such as dystonia, tremors, and unsteady gait. 
					</p>
					<p>
						Vitamin K2 activates Matrix Gla Protein (MGP) which inhibits the calcification of soft tissues, including blood vessels, kidneys, and the brain. Activated MGP ensures that calcium is directed away from these soft tissues and towards bones, where it is needed for bone mineralization, and the reduced vascular calcification improves cerebral blood flow.
					</p>
					
					<p>
						Both carboxylated and undercarboxylated osteocalcin (ucOCN) enter the bloodstream. ucOCN, which is not bound to the bone matrix, circulates and can act on various tissues, including the brain. Reduced calcification in the brain supports cognitive function and lowers the risk of neurodegenerative diseases, while preventing vascular calcification ensures adequate cerebral blood flow and overall brain health. <cite class="reflink"><a href="#k-maresz">K. Maresz</a></cite>
					</p>
					
					<h5>Supplementation</h5>
					<p>
						Vitamin K2 supplementation is generally safe, with no known serious side effects. It has been shown to be effective and well-tolerated at doses up to 45 mg per day in women with osteoporosis. <cite class="reflink"><a href="#t-giri">T. Giri</a></cite>

					<p>
						Ubiquinol is the reduced form of CoQ10. Ubiquinol is better absorbed by the body than ubiquinone, the oxidized form of CoQ10.
					</p>
					
					<p>
						CoQ10 improves mitochondrial function with exercise and improves cognitive function in chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS). <cite class="reflink"><a href="#s-fukuda">Sanae Fukuda</a></cite>
					<p>
						In Parkinson&rsquo;s, ubiquinol-10 may significantly improve PD with wearing off, as judged by total UPDRS scores, and is safe and well-tolerated. <cite class="reflink"><a href="#a-yoritaka">A. Yoritaka</a></cite>
					</p>
					<p>
						Previous studies using ubiquinone showed a lack of effect in PD patients. However, unlike ubiquinone, ubiquinol, the reduced form of CoQ10, is effective.
					</p>
				
					<h3>Ubiquinol in Parkinson's Disease</h3>
						
					<p>
						Mitochondrial dysfunction is one of the main factors of disease progression. Impaired mitochondrial function leads to increased oxidative stress and reduced ATP production, exacerbating neuronal damage. This dysfunction compromises cellular energy metabolism and impairs the ability of neurons to maintain their normal functions. Defective mitochondria contribute to the accumulation of toxic protein aggregates, including alpha-synuclein, leading to Lewy bodies, leading to senescence, further exacerbating neurodegeneration. <cite class="reflink"><a href="#a-ebrahimi">A. Ebrahimi</a>, <a href="#c-andreani">C. Andreani</a></cite>
					</p>
					<p>
						Addressing mitochondrial dysfunction in Parkinson's disease requires a multifaceted approach. High-dose CoQ10 supplementation is one way to improve mitochondrial function. <cite class="reflink"><a href="#m-spindler">M. Spindler</a></cite>
					</p>
					<p>
						Multiple system atrophy (MSA) is progressive neurodegeneration characterized by autonomic failure in various forms of Parkinsonism. This problem is exacerbated by decreased ubiquinone levels. Studies show that CoQ10 supplementation can reduce apoptosis in neurons derived from MSA patients. <cite class="reflink"><a href="#f-nakamoto">F. Nakamoto</a></cite>
					</p> 
					<p>
						CoQ10 transports electrons in the (<abbr title="electron transport chain">ETC</abbr>) to cross the mitochondrial inner membrane, generating cellular energy. <cite class="reflink"><a href="#m-spindler">M. Spindler</a></cite>
					</p>
	
					<h5>Supplementation</h5>
					<p>
						Ubiquinol has been demonstrated to be superior to ubiquinone. Phytosome Q10 has been shown to provide even greater absorption, but research shows strong safety and efficacy of ubiquinol, making it a reliable option for CoQ10 supplementation. <cite class="reflink"><a href="#p-langsjoen">P. Langsjoen</a>, <a href="#d-mantle">D. Mantle</a>, <a href="#g-petrangolini">G. Petrangolini</a></cite>
					</p>
					<p>
						In a study published in The Lancet, a patient with advanced Multiple System Atrophy (MSA) showed restored brain oxygen consumption after taking 1200 mg of oral ubiquinol. This finding suggests a potential benefit of high-dose ubiquinol supplementation in MSA patients to support mitochondrial function. <cite class="reflink"><a href="#j-mitsui">J. Mitsui</a></cite>

					Geranylgeraniol (GG)
				</h3>
				<ul class="treatment-rating">
					<li>Mechanisms: Mitochondrial, Helps DRT side-effects, Antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, Neuroprotective
					<li>Dose: 150 mg per day 🍽️
					<li>🩸🧠BBB: ✅? (probably)
					<li>Safety: 9/10 (85%)
					<li>Efficacy: 5/10 (30%)
				</ul>
				<p>
					Geranylgeraniol (GG) is an essential precursor for CoQ10, vitamin K2, cholesterol, and testosterone biosynthesis. It also plays a role in protein synthesis and modification. <cite class="reflink"><a href="#h-j-ho">h-j-ho</a></cite> 
				</p>
				
				<p>
					GG is synthesized naturally within the human body through the mevalonate (cholesterol) pathway, but its production decreases with age. This decline in GG synthesis can lead to decreased production of CoQ10, vitamin K2, and testosterone. <cite class="reflink"><a href="#h-j-ho">h-j-ho</a></cite> 
				</p>
														  
				
				<p>
					GG suppresses inflammation and modifies gut microbiota composition. <cite class="reflink"><a href="#e-chung">e-chung</a></cite> 
				</p>                     
				<h4>GG and Parkinson’s Disease</h4>
				<p>
					GG can likely cross the BBB (molecules with a <abbr title="Molecular Weight">MW</abbr> &lt; 400 <abbr title="daltons">Da</abbr> can cross it and GG's MW is 268.39 g/mol) and, if it does, this would confer an advantage over supplementation of CoQ10 (MW 731 (<a href="http://www.chemspider.com/Chemical-Structure.17216048.html">chemspider</a>)) and K2
					(MW 649.0 (<a href="https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/Menaquinone-7"
					>pubchem</a>)). 
				</p>
				
				<p>
					Dopamine synthesis is energetically demanding, relying on cellular energy. CoQ10 acts as a vital energy substrate for brain mitochondria, supporting their function and facilitating dopamine production and GG is an obligatory substrate for CoQ10 production. <cite class="reflink"><a href="#h-j-ho">h-j-ho</a>], <a href="#b-tan">b-tan</a></cite> 
				</p>
	
				<p>
					Given the uncertainty regarding CoQ10's BBB permeability, supplementing GG may ensure CoQ10 availability in the brain.
				</p>
				<h4>Mechanism of Action</h4>
				<p>
					GG converts mevalonic acid (MVA), the precursor for cholesterol, to CoQ10, K2, and sex hormones. It protects mitochondrial function.
				</p>
				
				<p>
					CoQ10 and vitamin K2 are primarily synthesized endogenously in the body and the brain. Evidence suggests that some forms of CoQ10 and vitamin K2 can cross the BBB, however, this is not well established. 
				</p>
	
				<h4>Supplementation</h4>
				<p>
					GG extracted from annatto is used to produce GG, a fat-soluble, orally bioavailable supplement that probably crosses the BBB and aids in CoQ10 biosynthesis. 
				</p>
	
				<p>
					Supplementing geranyl geraniol is considered very safe because the body has a natural regulatory mechanism to keep levels from exceeding a healthy range.

				<h3>Cholinergics and Membrane Support</h3>
				
				<p>
					Cholinergic supplementation has been shown to improves cognitive function, increase physical power output, provide neuroprotection, and improve conditions of neurological disorders. Restoring phosphatidylcholine (PC) to healthy levels has been shown to combat neurological decline and reduce DRT dependence and its associated side effects. <cite class="reflink"><a href="#m-zhou">M. Zhou</a>, <a href="#m-amalric">M. Amalric</a>, <a href="#b-s-baumel">B.S. Baumel</a></cite>
				</p>
	
				<p>
					Cholinergic supplements support neuronal health by maintaining cell membrane integrity, enhancing neurotransmitter synthesis, and promoting neuroprotection. This helps sustain cognitive function and neuronal survival, particularly relevant for managing neurodegenerative conditions like PD.
				</p>
				
				<p>
					Given the interdependence between the cholinergic and dopaminergic systems, this section focuses on cholinergic supplements uridine monophosphate (UMP), CDP-Choline, alpha-GPC, and phosphatidylserine (PS). 
				</p>
				
				<h4>Cholinergic and Dopaminergic Interdependence</h4>
				<p>
					The cholinergic and dopaminergic systems interact and converge in various brain regions, including the basal ganglia and hippocampus, to regulate cognition, movement, and behavior. Disruption of these interactions contributes to the symptoms of PD.
				</p>
				
				<h4>Interactions with DRT</h4>
				<p>
					Supplementation with CDP-choline, UMP, and alpha-GPC reduces the need for DRT and should be considered and monitored under medical supervision. However, the benefits of these supplements extend beyond merely reducing the required dose of DRT. <cite class="reflink"><a href="#r-eberhardt">R. Eberhardt</a></cite>
				</p>
				
				<p>
					Phosphatidylserine (PS) levels are often decreased in idiopathic PD and its supplementation may also alleviate dopamine replacement therapy (DRT) side effects. <cite class="reflink"><a href="#g-zhai">G. Zhai</a></cite>
				</p>
	
	
				<h4>Cholinergics Example Stack</h4>
				<p>
					An example cholinergic supplement stack might include UMP and CDP-choline at 250 mg each, twice daily, 500 mg alpha-GPC pre-workout, 200 mg PS after dinner, and 3000 mg DHA daily.
				</p>
	
				<h4>Phospholipids and Alpha-Synuclein</h4>

					Experimental evidence suggests that phospholipids alter the structure and reduce the toxicity of α-synuclein oligomers. <cite class="reflink"><a href="#t-dou">T. Dou</a></cite>

						Uridine is a type of nucleoside, a fundamental component of nucleic acids. Nucleic acids are the building blocks of life and are used for storage and transmission of genetic information.
					</p>
							
					<h4>How it Works</h4>
					<p>
						As explained under the section DHA &amp; Uridine, Uridine restores unilateral dopaminergic neurotransmission, transmission from the substantia nigra to the striatum, when that region is impacted by oxidopamine lesions in rodent models. Research shows the best results when uridine use used in conjunction with DHA and choline (more on this appears below). <cite class="reflink"><a href="#m-cansev">M. Cansev</a></cite>

						Phosphatidylcholine (PC), the most abundant phospholipid in the brain, requires three compounds: choline; a pyrimidine such as uridine; and a polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) such as DHA. <q>When all three of the nutrients are provided concurrently, the resulting increase in PC production is greater than the sum of the increases produced by giving each separately.</q> <cite class="reflink"><a href="#r-j-wurtman">R.J. Wurtman</a></cite> 
					</p>
					<p>
						DHA has been shown to restore dopaminergic neurotransmission loss in PD models, with enhanced effects when combined with UMP. <cite class="reflink"><a href="#m-cansev">M. Cansev</a></cite> 
					</p>
					<p>
						In a 2006 study conducted by researchers from two universities, Brain <abbr title="Phosphatidylcholine">PC</abbr> rose by 13&ndash;22% with uridine and choline alone, or DHA alone, or by 45% with the combination. Oral administration of uridine or DHA alone was shown to increase synaptic proteins and phospholipids, and in combination, a synergistic effect was noticed. Later research confirmed the cognitive benefits of these effects. <cite class="reflink"><a href="#s-holguin">S. Holguin</a></cite>

						CDP-Choline (Cytidine 5'-diphosphocholine)
					</h3>
					<ul>
						<li>Mechanisms: Neuroprotective, Mitochondrial, Dopaminergic side-effects, Senolytic
						<li>Dose: 500mg ED 
						<li>Fat-soluble: ❌
						<li>BBB: ✅ CDP-Choline’s metabolites cross the BBB 
						<li>Safety: 8/10 (80% σ)
						<li>Efficacy: 7/10 (85% σ)
					</ul>
					<p>
						CDP-Choline (cytidine diphosphate-choline, also "Citicoline") is an essential intermediate in the biosynthetic pathway of structural phospholipids, particularly <abbr title="Phosphatidylcholine">PC</abbr>, found in cell membranes through the body, especially the liver and brain. <cite class="reflink"><a href="#jj-secades">J.J. Secades</a></cite>
					</p>
					
					<p>
						CDP-Choline supports cognitive function, including memory, and offers neuroprotection, potentially slowing age-related cognitive decline and supporting brain health in neurodegenerative diseases.
					</p>
					<p>
						It increases brain choline uptake for PC and acetylcholine production, for neuronal membranes and myelin sheaths. Clinical studies show its benefits for brain health in patients with mild cognitive impairment and other neurological conditions.
					</p>
					
					<p>                                     
						CDP-Choline has several benefits over direct <abbr title="Phosphatidylcholine">PC</abbr> supplementation through its efficient metabolic conversion and broader physiological effects. CDP-Choline is digested into cytidine and choline, which are absorbed into the bloodstream and can then be reassembled into CDP-Choline within cells. Directly supplementing does not achieve the same level of metabolic conversion and physiological effects.  <cite class="reflink"><a href="#u-kansakar">U. Kansakar</a></cite>
					</p>
					
					<p>
						CDP-Choline's many beneficial effects and supporting evidence are explained by the large role it plays in the body.
					</p>
					<p>
						In rat brains, citicoline induced sirtuin expression, which was also observed in cultured neurons and lymphocytes, suggesting that a significant neurovascular protections is conferred by citicoline (either directly or indirectly) via SIRT-1. <cite class="reflink"><a href="#f-oddone">F. Oddone</a></cite>
					</p>
					
					<h4>CDP-Choline and the BBB</h4>
					<p>
						The breakdown products cytidine and choline cross the BBB and are reassembled to provide a synergistic impact on brain function and cellular health.
					</p>
					
					<h4>CDP-Choline in PD</h4>
					<p>
						CDP-Choline supplementation can effectively reduce the dosage and consequential side effects of <abbr title="Dopamine Replacement Therapy">DRT</abbr>. <cite class="reflink"><a href="#r-eberhardt">R. Eberhardt</a></cite>
					</p>
					
					<p>
						Glutamate excitotoxicity is a problem of cellular damage in PD and various other neurodegenerative diseases. This happens when neurons are damaged and killed by the excessive glutamate.  <cite class="reflink"><a href="#f-a-arnold">Arnold</a></cite>
					</p>
					
					<p>     
						CDP-Choline reduces glutamate excitotoxicity and oxidative stress, increases neurotrophin levels, enhances neurotransmitter release (such as norepinephrine and dopamine), promotes mitochondrial function, and modulates insulin signaling. <cite class="reflink"><a href="#c-mir">C. Mir</a></cite>
					</p>
					
					<p>
						Neurotrophins BDNF and NT-3, a protein growth factor that belongs to the NGF (Nerve Growth Factor) family of neurotrophins, are reduced in PD. This is problematic, as neurotrophins increase neuronal survival and growth. Their depletion in PD likely contributes to progressive neurodegeneration (PN). CDP-choline increases neurotrophin activity and expression, which is neuroprotective, and are reported to have noticeable positive effects. <cite class="reflink"><a href="#k-a-jellinger">Jellinger</a>, <a href="#p-arenth">P. Arenth</a></cite>
					</p>
					
					<p>
					 A 2022 review found profound neurological and cognitive benefits from some choline-containing phospholipids (CCPLs), in particular alpha-GPC, and also CDP-choline. They attribute these results by the improvement on ischemic conditions, increased synthesis of phospholipids and neurotransmitters, incorporation into the membrane phospholipid structure, and improved mitochondrial metabolism. <cite class="reflink"><a href="#p-roy">P. Roy</a></cite>
					</p>
					
					<h4>Ischemic Mitigation</h4>
					<p>
						 In patients with chronic cerebral ischemia, citicoline improves scores on cognitive rating scales. CDP-choline prevents ischemia-induced tissue accumulation of free fatty acids and reduces infarct volume (direct measurement of the extent of tissue death or necrosis caused by an ischemic stroke), and brain edema, thus resulting in an antiapoptotic effect that is related to the mitochondrial-dependent cell death mechanism. <cite class="reflink"><a href="#jj-secades">J.J. Secades</a></cite>
					</p>
					
					<p>
						CDP-coline improves axonal transport deficits and supports axon regeneration. Axon regeneration is limited in adults, partly due to the reduced growth potential of mature neurons. <cite class="reflink"><a href="#f-oddone">F. Oddone</a>, <a href="#c-iulia">Iulia</a></cite>
					</p>
	
					<h5>Uridine and CDP-Choline</h5>
					<p>
						CDP-Choline aids in the synthesis of <abbr title="Phosphatidylcholine">PC</abbr> and serves as a precursor to choline and uridine in the brain. Uridine, a nucleotide base, can convert to back CDP-choline and vice versa through natural metabolic pathways.
					</p>
					
					<p>
						Supplementing with both uridine and CDP-Choline together can significantly benefit brain health and cognitive function, often allowing for lower doses of each. This combination enhances neuroprotection, memory, and learning by boosting acetylcholine production. These synergistic effects are increased with the addition of <abbr title="Docosahexanoic Acid">DHA</abbr>. <cite class="reflink"><a href="#b-s-baumel">B.S. Baumel</a></cite>
					</p>
	
					<p>
						Both uridine and CDP-Choline are neuroprotective and independently contribute to the production of PC, which supports acetylcholine synthesis and enhances cell membrane integrity.
					</p>
					<p>
						Because Uridine increases CDP-choline levels, it is necessary to balance their co-supplemention. Uridine is a precursor to CDP-choline, increasing uridine levels can potentially affect the balance of these two compounds in the body.
					</p>
					
					<p>
						Uridine and CDP-choline work synergistically to enhance brain health and cognitive function. CDP-choline aids in the synthesis of <abbr title="Phosphatidylcholine">PC</abbr> and serves as a precursor to both choline and uridine in the brain. Uridine can convert to CDP-choline and also supports RNA synthesis during cell growth and repair. Combined, these compounds enhance memory and learning by boosting acetylcholine production, improve cell membrane integrity, and provide neuroprotection. UMP, a precursor to uridine, supports dopamine levels and contributes to the synthesis of CDP-choline, making it essential to balance their supplementation for optimal effects.
					</p>
					
					<p>
					   Citicoline is generally well-tolerated with no serious side effects reported. However, excessive supplementation may cause imbalances, especially in advanced stages of disease.
					</p>
					
					<h5>CDP-Choline Supplementation</h5>
					<p>
						A typical dosage of 500 mg CDP-choline ED is considered safe for most people, but individual tolerance may vary.
					</P>
					<p>
						The effects of CDP-choline vary on individual bases and are affected by other supplements and medications being used, so the dose will need to be custom-tailored.
					</p>
					
					<h5>Anticholinergics ❌ CAUTION</h5>
					<p>
						Contrary to the dying myth, acetylcholine does not cause the tremors of PD. The drugs <em>given</em> to reduce CDP-choline in PD, such as Trihexyphenidyl and Benztropine, impact neurological function, resulting in confusion, memory issues, hallucinations, dry mouth, blurry vision, and urinary retention problems &mdash; serious side effects.
					</p>
					
					<p>
					<em>Increasing</em> choline by 1,200 mg of supplemental citicoline improved tremors in PD and allowed patients to halve their L-dopa + decarboxylase inhibitor dose. Uridine increases CDP. It's important to have a healthcare provider that understands and accounts for this as part of a holistic plan.
					</p>
					
					<p>
						CDP-choline, uridine monophosphate (UMP), and alpha-GPC can augment the effects of DRT due to their neurotransmitter synthesis, particularly acetylcholine, which can interact with dopamine pathways. It is important to balance their supplementation DRT under medical supervision.

						Alpha-GPC (L-alpha-glycerylphosphorylcholine) is a highly bioavailable, naturally occurring form of choline that is synthesized for dietary supplements.
					</p>
					
					<h4>Benefits</h4>
					<p>
						Alpha-GPC increases the release of acetylcholine, promotes learning and memory, and counters cognitive impairment. It has been shown to decrease age-dependent structural alterations in the frontal cortex and hippocampus of rats' brains. <cite class="reflink"><a href="#f-amenta">F. Amenta</a></cite> 
					</p>
					
					<p>
						A review study published in Fronteirs in Cell Neuroscience highlighted some of the amazing benefits of alpha-GPC, considering the most promising molecule for brain disorders characterized by vascular impairment and called for larger attentively controlled studies. 
					</p>
					
					<p>
						Citing a rodent model study, they highlighted how administration of α-GPC (400 mg/kg) for 7 days countered the increase of stress hormones, reduced hearing loss, and prevented neuronal injury in rats. These neuroprotective effects were due to the increase of choline acetyltransferase (ChAT), reduction of brain neuroinflammation, and enhanced BDNF expression in the hippocampus. 
					</P>
					
					<p>
						The researchers cited other research showing that Alpha-GPC contributes to anabolic processes responsible for membrane phospholipid and glycerol-lipid synthesis, positively influencing membrane fluidity. <cite class="reflink"><a href="#p-roy-gpc">P. Roy</a></cite> 
					</p>
					
					<h4>Alpha-GPC and Exercise</h4>
					
					<p>
						A double blind, placebo controlled, cross-over design study in 2015 found that 600 mg per day of alpha-GPC increased lower body force production after just 6 days, making a recommendation for speed and power athletes to enhance muscle performance. <cite class="reflink"><a href="#d-bellar">Bellar</a></cite> 
					</p>
					
					<p>
						Another small, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover study found that alpha-GPC supplementation prevents exercise-induced reductions in choline levels, increases endurance performance, and increases growth hormone secretion. <cite class="reflink"><a href="#a-parker">Parker</a></cite> 
					</p>
					
					<h4>Side effects</h4>
					<p>
						Alpha-GPC may increase the production of Trimethylamine-N-oxide (TMAO) in the gut, which may increase the risk of stroke. A review study published in 2021 found that alpha-GPC usage was associated with a 46% higher risk of stroke. <cite class="reflink"><a href="#g-lee">G. Lee</a></cite> 
					</p>
									
					<h4>Supplementation</h4>
					<p>
						Alpha-GPC's rapid uptake leads to sharp increases in acetylcholine make it an excellent choice 60 min prior to training sessions of maximal power output, as part of a total cholinergic stack. Typical pre-workout dosage is 300 - 600 mg pre-workout.

					<h3>Phosphatidylserine (PS)</h3>

						<li>Dose: 150mg Post-workout, 150mg 💤
						<li>Fat-soluble: ✅
						<li>BBB: ✅ 
						<li>Safety: 6/10 (50% σ)
						<li>Efficacy: 6/10 (60% σ)
					</ul>
					
					<h4>Benefits</h4>
					<p>
						Phosphatidylserine (PS) is an essential component of cellular membranes. It helps regulate membrane support, signal transduction, inhibits neuroinflammation, provides neuroprotection, and improves cognitive function.
					</p>
					
					<h4>Details and Mechanisms</h4>
					<p>
						PS binds to various proteins and is involved in many biological processes, including enzyme activation, apoptosis, neurotransmission, and synaptic refinement. Dysregulation of these processes is common in various CNS diseases. <cite class="reflink"><a href="#x-ma">X. Ma</a></cite>
					</p>
					
					<p>
						In a double-blind study, elderly patients with severe cognitive decline were treated with brain cortex-derived PS (BC-PS) 300 mg/day for 6 months, compared with placebos, BC-PS administration significantly improved the storage, learning, and retrieval abilities of memory in patients. <cite class="reflink"><a href="#x-ma">X. Ma</a></cite>
					</p>
					
					<h4>PS as a Self-emulsifying Drug Delivery System (SEDDS)</h4> 
					<p>
						SEDDS (Self-Emulsifying Drug Delivery Systems) are formulations designed to improve the oral bioavailability of poorly water-soluble substances. While PS itself is not a SEDDS, taking it with such substances may enhance their absorption and bioavailability. This is because it is both. PS liposomes loaded with astragaloside IV and nestifin-1 were shown to facilitate their penetration of the blood-brain barrier and reduce the expression of α-synuclein, making PS liposome an effective delivery tool for other substances. <cite class="reflink"><a href="#y-kuo">Y. Kuo</a></cite>
					</p>
	
					<h4>Supplementation — Brain-Derived PS (Choric PS)</h4>
					<p>
						 PS promotes relaxation and reduces cortisol, making it a good choice for an post-workout recovery and evening supplementation at about 100 mg - 400 mg once or twice daily. <cite class="reflink"><a href="#m-kingsley">M. Kingsley</a></cite>

				Magnesium L-Threonate is a highly bioavailable form of magnesium that, unlike most magnesium supplements, crosses the blood-brain barrier to strongly support brain health and cognitive function. 
				</p>
				
				<p>
					In a 2019 rodent study where magnesium L-Threonate was compared to magnesium sulfate, was shown that only the L-Threonate form crossed the blood-brain barrier, where it then inhibited oxidative stress, attenuated motor deficits, and slowed the progression of neurodegeneration. <cite class="reflink"><a href="#y-shen">Y.

				<p>
					 A 2022 study from Nanjing Medical University found that Magtein® significantly improved memory and cognition in healthy Chinese adults, with greater benefits in older participants. <cite class="reflink"><a href="#c-zhang">C. Zhang</a></cite> 
				</p>
	
				<h4>Supplementation</h4>
				<p>
					Magnesium can promote relaxation and improve sleep quality. Therefore, it is recommended to take this supplement in the evening.

					Vitamin D3
				</h3>
				<!--
				Vitamin D3, or cholecalciferol, is a fat-soluble vitamin essential for various bodily functions. It aids in calcium absorption, supporting bone health and helping prevent conditions like osteoporosis. Beyond its role in bone maintenance, Vitamin D3 influences immune function and mood. It is synthesized through sunlight exposure and can also be obtained from diet and supplements. Its potential benefits in neurological health, particularly in conditions like Parkinson's disease, are an area of ongoing research.
				-->
				<p>
					Vitamin D3 stimulates the osteoblasts to produce osteocalcin (OCN). Vitamin K2 converts some of this osteocalcin into its active form, carboxylated OCN. The remaining undercarboxylated OCN (ucOCN) enters the bloodstream and acts as a hormone in various tissues, including the brain. <cite class="reflink"><a href="#c-shan">C. Shan</a></cite>
				</p>
				
				<h4>D3 and Parkinson's Disease</h4>
				<p>
					The Parkinson’s Disease Research, Education, and Clinical Center at the Portland and Puget Sound Veteran Affairs (VA) Clinics conducted an add-on study to a longitudinal study on neuropsychiatric function in individuals with PD. Researchers found that higher plasma vitamin D levels were associated with improved cognition and mood in PD patients without dementia. <cite class="reflink"><a href="#a-peterson">A. Peterson</a></cite>
				</p>
				
				<h4>Supplementation</h4>
				<p>
					More is not always better! Too much vitamin D3 can disturb calcium levels. Vitamin D3 levels can be optimized with regular bloodwork and refined supplementation accordingly. 4,000 IU per day is safe. D3 is stored in the body, so a missed dose can be compensated by doubling the intake the next day.

				<dl>
					<dt>Tocopherols</dt>
					<dd><strong>α-</strong> — most common and studied form, antioxidant, immune-enhancing, vascular and skin effects</dd>
					<dd><strong>β-</strong> — antioxidant, anti-inflammatory</dd>

					<dd><strong>δ-</strong> — anti-cancer, strong antioxidant</dd>
				</dl>
				
				<p>
					Tocotrienols are neuroprotective, anti-cancer, anti-oxidative, and cholesterol-lowering in ways tocopherols aren't. Most vitamin E supplements are only alpha-tocopherol, which has the effect of reducing the body's levels of gamma tocopherol. This is bad, because unlike alpha-tocopherol, gamma-tocopherol and delta-tocopherol can scavenge reactive nitrogen species in addition to reactive oxygen species. <cite class="reflink"><a href="#a-abraham">A. Abraham</a>, <a href="#m-clarke">M. Clarke</a>, <a href="#d-wolf">D. Wolf</a></cite>
				</p>
				<p> 
					Consuming the full spectrum of all eight natural forms of vitamin E avoids problems with unilateral α-tocopherol supplementation and provides maximum synergy and health benefit. <cite class="reflink"><a href="#c-sen">C. Sen</a></cite>
				</p>
	
				<h5>Neuroprotective Effects</h5>
				
				<p>
					Tocotrienols have been shown to improve learning impairment in elderly subjects. A 2018 double-blind study out of Japan showed that the combination of tocotrienols with astaxanthin improves the composite memory and verbal memory of Japanese adults who feel a memory decline. Astaxanthin and vitamin E are anti-oxidative, but tocotrienols are more than that. <cite class="reflink"><a href="#t-sekikawa">T. Sekikawa</a></cite>
				</p>
				
				<p>
					Tocotrienols cross the BBB, exerting neuroprotective effects independent of their antioxidant activity by binding to the estrogen receptor, as shown in multiple studies. <cite class="reflink"><a href="#t-matsura">T. Matsura</a>, <a href="#r-naomi">R. Naomi</a></cite>
			   </p>
			   
			   <p>
				   Tocotrienols also reduce BBB permeability by modulating tight junction proteins and reducing oxidative and inflammatory damage to the BBB. This helps maintain its integrity, which is essential for protecting the brain. <cite class="reflink"><a href="n-kaneai">N. Kaneai</a></cite>
			   </p>
			   
			   <p>
					Tocotrienols more effectively inhibit lipid peroxidation compared to tocopherols, due to better incorporation into cell membranes. This action protects mitochondria and reduces oxidative stress. Tocotrienols have been shown to induce apoptosis of cancer cells while protecting neuronal cells from glutamate- and peroxidative-induced death. <cite class="reflink"><a href="#b-aggarwal">B. Aggarwal</a> <a href="#r-c-chiste">R.C. Chiste</a></cite>
				</p>
	
				<p>
					A 2021 controlled rodent model study showed that α- and γ- tocotrienols improved motor function and neuronal uptake in hippocampal cells, with α-tocotrienol demonstrating superior neuroprotective effects and preventing further reduction of dopaminergic neurons. <cite class="reflink"><a href="#m-kumari">M. Kumari</a></cite>
				</p>
				
				<h4>Human Trial Underway</h4>
				<p>
					A large scale human trial, <a title="Tocotrienols in Parkinson's Disease (PD): A Pilot, Randomised, Placebo-controlled Trial" href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT04491383" target="_blank"><q>Tocotrienols in Parkinson's Disease (PD): A Pilot, Randomised, Placebo-controlled Trial</q></a>, was opened on April 2021. This two-year study is designed to compare the effects of 400mg/day tocotrienols vs placebo on neuropsychological conditions using cognitive tests and bloodwork, to evaluate PD biomarkers and for safety monitoring. Tocotrienols are available over the counter, so participation in the trial is not required to use them.
				</p>
				
				<h4>Supplementation and Safety</h4>
	
				<p>
					Vitamin E is best taken with dietary fat and other fat-soluble supplements.
				</p>
				<p>
					Vitamin E can thin the blood. Individuals taking blood thinners, those with a history of stroke or brain bleeding should be cautious when taking vitamin E supplements.
				</p>
				<p>
					Light to moderate supplementation consisting of a naturally-sourced, balanced blend of the four tocotrienols and four tocopherols provides benefits while avoiding these risks. Do not exceed the recommended dose. High doses of vitamin E, particularly the synthetic form dl-alpha-tocopherol, are unhelpful to neurodegenerative conditions and are toxic.

				<h3>NAD+ and its precursors NMN, NR, and Niacin</h3>
	
				<h3>Nicotinamide Adenine Dinucleotide (NAD+)</h3>
				<p>
					NAD+ is a coenzyme involved in energy metabolism, DNA repair, and cell signaling.
				</p>
	
				<p>
					 NAD+ reduces oxidative stress (including in the brain). This promotes recovery on a cellular level and leads to better energy metabolism, neuroprotection, mitochondrial function, and DNA repair. 
				</p>
				
				<p>
					NAD+ affects macrophages to reduce the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and increase the production of anti-inflammatory cytokines.
				</p>
	
				<p>
					NAD+ promotes mitophagy, leading to mitogenesis. This promotes neuronal survival and function and decreases ROS. Lower ROS levels reduce oxidative stress, which can prevent the misfolding and aggregation of α-synuclein.
				</p>
				
				<h4>Declining NAD+ Levels</h4>
				<p>
					Declining NAD+ levels contribute to reduced mitochondrial function and impaired cellular energy metabolism in neurons, making them more susceptible to oxidative damage and degeneration, particularly in PD, necessitating intervention.
				</p>
	
				<p>
					Raising NAD levels (through injection, precursor supplementation, and upregulation via exercise) improves mitochondrial function and count in neuronal cells. This explains how it improves neurotransmission, synaptic plasticity, and improved motor symptoms.
				</p>
				<p>
					NAD+ is essential for mitochondrial function which is significant in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease.
				</p>
				<h4>NAD Precursors</h4>
				<p>
					Supplementation with NAD precursors NMN, NR, and niacin, increases cellular levels of NAD+ (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide). Among these, NMN appears to be the safest, best-tolerated, and most effective in increasing NAD+ production. This is because NMN converts to NAD+ more directly than the other precursors.
				</p>
	
				<p>
					Niacin increases NAD+ levels but through a different metabolic pathway than NMN and NR.

				<h3>Senolytics</h3>
				<p>
					Senolytics are used to selectively induce the death of senescent cells. Senolytic means "senescent cell destruction".

				<h4>Senolytics in Parkinson's Disease</h4>
				<p>
					Senolytics inhibit and help degrade &alpha;-synuclein aggregation.
				</p>
				<p>
					In PD, &alpha;-synuclein and especially its mutant forms damage mitochondria, causing a leak of sirtuins from the inner membrane of the mitochondria leading to mitochondrial failure and eventual cell failure.
				</p>
				<p>
					Aggregates of &alpha;-synuclein form Lewy bodies inside the cell and block T-cells from activating the lysosome of non-functioning "zombie" cells.
				</p>
				<p>
					Senolytics help prevent the formation of &alpha;-synuclein aggregates. This has numerous benefits, including neuroprotection, decreased neuroinflammation, improved mitochondrial function, neurogenesis, and autophagy.

					<h3>Urolithin-A</h3>
					<ul>
						<li>Mechanisms: Antioxidant, Anti-inflammatory, Mitochondrial, Neuroprotective, Neurorestorative, Anti-aggregant
						<li>Dose: 1000mg ED
						<li>Fat-soluble: ✅
						<li>🩸🧠 BBB: ✅
						<li>Safety: 8/10 (80% σ)
						<li>Efficacy: 6/10 (70% σ)
					</ul>
					
					<h4>Overview</h4>
					<p>
						Urolithin-A is a naturally occurring compound produced by gut bacteria through the transformation of polyphenols, such as ellagitannins and ellagic acid, found in small amounts of some foods like wild berries (pomegranates, etc), walnuts, and tea. Urolithin-A supplementation stimulates mitophagy and mitochondrial function in several tissues.
					</p>
					
					<h4>Benefits</h4>
					<p>
						Urolithin-A-induced mitophagy promotes mitogenesis. This promotes neuronal survival and function, making Urolithin-A strongly neuroprotective. <cite class="reflink"><a href="#p-andreux">P. Andreux</a></cite>
					</p>
					
					<h4>Mitophagy</h4>
					<p>
						Mitophagy is a cellular process that recycles and removes damaged or unhealthy mitochondria, leading to their replacement with new, healthy mitochondria. 
					</p>
					
					<h5>Urolithin-A and the PINK1-Parkin Pathway</h5>
					
					<p>
						The PINK1-Parkin pathway is necessary for the removal of damaged mitochondria. In some conditions, including PD, it is impacted. When PINK1 enters healthy mitochondria, the mitochondria remove it. However, when the mitochondria are damaged, PINK1 accumulates on the outer membrane. This signals the recruitment of Parkin to the outer membrane, which marks the damaged mitochondria for recognition by autophagosomes. The autophagosomes engulf the damaged mitochondria and transport them to the cell's lysosome for degradation. This process, known as <dfn>mitophagy</dfn>, signals the cell to initiate  <dfn>mitochondrial biogenesis</dfn>, restoring cellular energy and function.
					</p>
					
					<h4>Mitophagy in Parkinson's Disease</h4>
					<p>
						In PD, there is an abnormally higher number of damaged mitochondria. These damaged mitochondria accumulate alpha-synuclein and contribute to the formation of Lewy bodies. Inducing mitophagy helps clear these harmful mitochondria and restore cellular energy production. This process protects against dopaminergic neurodegeneration.
					</p>
					
					<p>
						A 2021 study using a PD-induced rodent model found urolithin-A exerted neuroprotective effects by promoting mitochondrial biogenesis via SIRT1-PGC-1α signaling pathway and ameliorated both motor deficits and nigral-striatal dopaminergic neurotoxicity. <cite class="reflink"><a href="#jia-liu">J. Liu</a></cite>
					</p>
	
					<p>
						A 2019 rodent study out of Guangzhou, China found Urolithin-A, in a mouse model of AD, significantly improved spatial learning and memory, protected neurons from death, reduced neuroinflammation, and triggered neurogenesis. <cite class="reflink"><a href="#z-gong">Z. Gong</a></cite>
					</p>
					<p>
						A 2023 review study found Urolithin-A was neuroprotective, protected against brain injuries, improved mitophagy and overall mitochondrial functions of the nerve cells, inhibited monoamine oxidase, and reduced cognitive decline. <cite class="reflink"><a href="#o-wojciechowska">O.

					<h4>Exercise Performance</h4>
					<p>
						A 2022 <abbr title="randomized controlled trial">RCT</abbr> found Urolithin-A improved muscle strength, exercise performance, and biomarkers of mitochondrial health in a randomized trial in middle-aged adults. <cite class="reflink"><a href="#a-singh">A. Singh</a></cite>

					</p>
					
					<h4>Supplementation</h4>
					
					<p>
						1000mg per day of Urolithin-A is safe and well-tolerated in humans.
					</p>
					
					<p>
						Urolithin-A is fat-soluble and can cross the BBB. Taking with food or other fat-soluble vitamins may improve absorption. 
					</p>
					
					<h4>Food Sources</h4>
						Pomegranates contain ellagitannins, convertible to urolithin A by gut bacteria in 30% to 50% of people. Optimistically, eating 1 pomegranate might yield a negligible 2 milligrams of Urolithin-A &mdash; <em>not enough</em>!             
					
					<h4>Side Effects</h4>
					<p>
						Potential unknown side effects might include gastric upset or potential interactions with certain medications that also undergo hepatic metabolism.  Taking with food may help.

        <p>
            Ultimately, health is a personal matter, and addressing it is an individual responsibility. This guide serves as an outline intended to aid in addressing this issue and maximizing one's health span based on the latest scientific research, rather than healthcare dogma, falsehoods, or empty promises meant to boost self-esteem.

        <p>
            Narratives designed to foster good self-estimation provide a false sense of reality, create dependence on external validation, impact relationships, and lead to missed opportunities for improvement. This guide lays a solid foundation for digging beneath the surface, separating fact from fiction, and looking at things from all angles. The responsibility now rests with you to take proactive steps forward.
