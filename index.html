        <h2>The Purpose of This Guide</h2>

        <p>
            This guide is crafted to empower individuals with Parkinson's Disease (PD) to optimize their health using the latest scientific evidence. It covers disease etiology, medication, exercise performance, diet and supplementation, care providers, photobiomodulation, and more, offering practical strategies for effective management and enhanced well-being.
        </p>
        <p>
            Started in 2021, this guide was inspired by a relative with PD who chose to eschew evidence-based strategies rather than investigate their veracity and incorporate them into her program. Her condition deteriorated due to complications of autonomic nervous system (ANS) failure, with gastrointestinal and heart problems. This guide reflects core principles of volition, self-ownership, evidence-based practice, informed decision-making, first principles, and critical thinking, aimed at helping others make proactive, informed choices to improve their health outcomes.

        <h2>How to Use This Guide</h2>
        <p>
            This guide is meant to be explored at an individual pace. Parkinson's Disease is complex, and oversimplifying it would leave many questions unanswered. Understanding the disease is a fundamental step toward improvement; however, it isn't necessary to grasp every technical detail immediately. Solutions, such as those in <a href="#how-to-build-a-supplement-plan">How to Build a Supplement Plan</a>, can be applied right away, with gaps in understanding revisited later through sections like <a href="#causes-of-pd">Causes</a>, which covers the deep biological mechanisms and etiology necessary for comprehending PD.
        </p>
        <p>
            The guide is designed as a resource that can be revisited as the reader's knowledge grows, supporting gradual understanding and informed decision-making. If the material becomes overwhelming, focus on actionable sections like supplements or diet, and return to other parts when ready. Taking breaks or breaking the information into smaller steps can also aid comprehension.

        <h2>Introduction to Parkinson's Disease</h2>

        <p>
            Parkinson’s Disease (PD) is a neurological condition characterized by tremor, muscle stiffness, impaired balance, and coordination. These symptoms are driven by the aggregation of the pre-synaptic protein α-synuclein, which disrupts multiple neurotransmitter systems. This disruption leads to damage in the dopaminergic system, oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, and weakening of protective brain barriers, all of which broaden the range and severity of symptoms.
        </p>

        <p>
            PD primarily affects the central nervous system (CNS), with overlapping symptoms haphazardly categorized by mainstream medicine into "motor" and "non-motor" symptoms. Neurological problems may spread to the autonomic nervous system (ANS), parasympathetic nervous system (PNS), and enteric nervous system (ENS), contributing to <abbr title="Gastrointestinal">GI</abbr> issues, low blood pressure, urinary dysfunction, renal issues, and orthostatic hypotension. 
        </p>
        
        <p>
            Mitochondrial dysfunction is a fundamental problem in PD, impairing cellular energy production, promoting oxidative damage, and disrupting calcium regulation. These dysfunctions create harmful feedback loops that exacerbate α-synuclein aggregation and neuronal damage.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            Although dopamine loss remains a central focus in conventional PD treatment, GABAergic dysfunction is a more fundamental causative factor, as has been well-documented since the 1980s, with research showing alterations in receptor binding and transmission (Rinne et al.). Despite this established evidence, there is no standard treatment specifically targeting GABA or mitochondrial dysfunction in PD. Instead, mainstream treatments focus predominantly on dopamine replacement, overlooking the problem of GABA system failure.
        </p>

        <p>
            Comprehensively addressing the multiple cellular problems of PD predicts better outcomes than the standard of care, and that is the approach taken in this guide.

            <h3>Causes and Risk Factors</h3>
            <p>
                PD involves abnormal clumping of α-synuclein, a protein that regulates neurotransmitter release to help neurons communicate. In PD, α-synuclein misfolds, disrupting brain function.
			</p>
            <p>
                Alpha-synuclein is abundant in the brain, but also exists in small amounts in the heart and muscles. It moves between the brain and body via the blood-brain and cerebrospinal fluid barriers, both affected in PD. <cite class="reflink"><a href="#yu-ting-sui">Y. Sui</a></cite>
            </p>
            			
			<p> 
                In PD, α-synuclein misfolds, forming clumps called oligomers. Oligomers can grow into fibrils, larger, more harmful aggregates, eventually forming Lewy bodies, driving senescence. Similar α-synuclein misfolding occurs in related disorders, such as dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) and multiple system atrophy (MSA), whose research on α-synuclein misfolding is relevant. 
            </p>            
            <p>
                Aging, environmental hazards, and genetics interact pathologically, leading to neuronal death and neurotransmitter imbalances, α-synuclein aggregation, and mitochondrial dysfunction—another major factor in disease progression, causing oxidative damage, apoptosis, and neuroinﬂammation, driving disease progression. <cite class="reflink"><a href="#k-burton">K. Burton</a></cite>
            </p>
            
            <section id="alpha-synuclein-pathology">    
                <h4>Alpha-Synuclein Pathology</h4>
                <p>
                    Mutations in α-synuclein increase its tendency to clump, particularly in familial PD cases <cite class="reflink"><a href="#v-c-ruf">V. Ruf</a>, <a href="#jie-li">J. Li</a></cite>. Misfolded or mutant forms resist breakdown, leading to toxic buildup, cellular stress, inflammation, waste accumulation, and Lewy body formation. Over time, these damaged cells become senescent, releasing toxic compounds that fuel neurodegeneration.
                </p>

                <h4>Alpha-Synuclein Aggregation</h4>
                <p>
                    α-synuclein aggregation leads to formation of oligomers, which can then form fibrils (see figure below). As oligomers and fibrils accumulate, they create Lewy bodies—dense, toxic protein clusters in nerve cells.

                <h5 id="alpha-synuclein-clearance">Alpha-Synuclein Clearance Mechanisms</h5>
                <p>
                    Healthy cells clear small misfolded proteins with the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) and larger aggregates with the autophagy-lysosome pathway (ALP).
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    In PD, the structure of misfolded α-synuclein and its sheer volume hinder its degradation and clearance. Misfolded α-synuclein aggregates are not efficiently broken down by the proteasome, leading to their buildup and overwhelming the <abbr title="ubiquitin proteasome system">UPS</abbr>. When the proteasome fails to degrade these aggregates, they are directed to the <abbr title="autophagy-lysosomal pathway">ALP</abbr>, where α-synuclein fibrils further resist lysosomal breakdown. This resistance disrupts both clearance pathways, contributing to extracellular waste and increasing neuronal stress. While these processes are explored further in this guide, they remain outside conventional treatment approaches.

				<h5>Alpha-Synuclein Clearance Mechanisms</h5>
				<p>
					As shown in the diagram above, small misfolded proteins like α-synuclein are cleared by the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS), which tags unwanted proteins for degradation. Larger aggregates are managed by the autophagy-lysosome pathway (ALP), which transports them to lysosomes for breakdown.
				</p>
				<p>
					In PD, autophagosomes (structures that deliver cellular waste to lysosomes) try to clear away α-synuclein aggregates but become overwhelmed, leading to buildup of these aggregates that worsens cellular dysfunction.
				</p>
				<p>
					In PD, misfolded α-synuclein overwhelms both systems, resisting degradation and leading to toxic buildup. These and other waste clearance mechanisms of the brain are explored in greater detail in the section  <a href="#brain-waste-management-systems">Brain Waste Management Systems (BWMS)</a>.
				</p>

				
				<h5>What Causes Alpha-Synuclein Misfolding?</h5>
				<p>
					This raises a natural question: <em>What causes α-synuclein misfolding in the first place?</em>

					Aside from genetic mutations, multiple things can contribute to alpha-synuclein misfolding, including a toxic cellular environment caused by problems resulting from the misfolding α-synuclein itself — a recursive chicken-and-egg quandary. 
				</p>

				<h5>Propagation from Gut to Brain: The Braak Hypothesis</h5>
				<p>
					Misfolded α-synuclein propagating from the enteric nervous system (ENS), aka "the gut", to the brain, known as the Braak hypothesis, explained later, is one such causal pathway. This dysfunction is exacerbated by excess calcium in dopaminergic neurons, which rely on precise calcium signaling to maintain normal firing patterns. The hypothesis holds that the misfolding begins in the gut. However, PD is more complex, and as mentioned throughout, it is induced in rodents through rotenone and paraquat administration, which indicates that this phenomenological condition may come about in different ways.

				<h4>Calcium Dysregulation</h4>
				<p>
					Calcium dysregulation is a fundamental problem that contributes to α-synuclein misfolding. This can result from elevated parathyroid hormone (PTH), menopause, deficiencies in vitamin D, or magnesium imbalance. <cite class="reflink"><a href="#emmanouilidou">Emmanouilidou</a></cite>
				</p>

				<p>
					Calcium dysregulation may promote the spread of misfolded α-synuclein along the gut-brain axis via the vagus nerve, providing a mechanistic link to Braak’s hypothesis, which would implicate calcium dysregulation as a driver of PD.
				</p>

				<p>
					While elevated <abbr title="parathyroid hormones">PTH</abbr> can contribute to calcium dysregulation, addressing nutrient deficiencies and hormonal imbalances may better support neuronal health than pharmacological suppression of PTH, as drugs like cinacalcet, alendronate, and calcitriol carry significant side effects.
				</p>
				
				<h5>Intracellular Calcium Dysregulation: Pathway Overview</h5>
				<p>
					When a nerve impulse (or "action potential") reaches the presynaptic terminal (the end of the neuron), it triggers calcium channels (<abbr title="voltage-gated calcium channels">VGCCs</abbr>) to open, letting calcium into the neuron. Synaptic vesicles, specialized organelles responsible for storing and releasing neurotransmitters at chemical synapses, fuse with the presynaptic membrane, releasing their neurotransmitter contents into the synapse through a process called <dfn>exocytosis</dfn>, a form of active transport whereby neurons transport neurotransmitters out of the cell (<em>exo</em> — "outside" + <em>cytosis</em> — "cell").
				</p>

				<p>
					In healthy neurons, <abbr title="voltage-gated calcium channels">VGCCs</abbr> precisely regulate calcium influx, triggering neurotransmitter release only when a signal arrives. In PD, this regulation is disrupted, particularly in dopaminergic and GABAergic neurons, which depend on tight calcium control. These imbalances create an excitatory bias in neural networks, increasing neural stress.
				</p>
				
				<h5>Impact on Cellular Functions</h5>
				<p>
					Elevated calcium levels stress neurons, disrupt mitochondrial function, increase endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, and impair the clearance of misfolded proteins. Together, these disruptions heighten neuronal vulnerability, exacerbate α-synuclein aggregation, and contribute to PD pathology.
				</p>            
                
				<h5>Testing Calcium Dysregulation</h5>				
				<p>
					Standard blood tests measure total and ionized calcium, along with other electrolytes like magnesium and phosphate, but these don’t reveal intracellular calcium levels. 
				</p>
				<p>
					Flow cytometry with calcium-sensitive dyes can assess intracellular calcium levels. Although calcium dysregulation is common, testing is expensive and rare. Patients can ask their providers; it might be available through a specialist or in research settings.
				</p>

				<p>
					 Medical systems tend to focus more on symptom management than on detecting fundamental issues like calcium dysregulation, as preventive care doesn't align with the predominant healthcare focus on symptomatic treatment. This approach can leave patients without access to meaningful insights on calcium imbalances, complicating targeted intervention.
				</p>
				
				<p>
					Most patients lack direct information about their intracellular calcium levels, and this complicates targeted intervention. The supplement guide includes several categories of compounds that, while often safe when used appropriately, require careful attention to dosage, interactions, and individual health profiles to avoid unintended effects on calcium homeostasis. See: <a href="#solution-calcium-dysregulation">Solution: Calcium Dysregulation</a> and consult your provider about these interventions.

                <p>
                    Senescent cells stop dividing but release harmful, pro-inflammatory molecules called <dfn>senescence-associated secretory phenotypes</dfn> (SASPs). These secretions damage neighboring cells, promoting their dysfunction and driving them into a senescent state.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Senescent cells contribute to mitochondrial dysfunction, neuroinflammation, and the spread of α-synuclein aggregates. By impairing autophagy, increasing oxidative stress, and perpetuating inflammation, they create a cycle disrupts calcium homeostasis, and accelerates disease progression across neurotransmitter systems.

                <h4>Multiple Neurotransmitter Systems Damage</h4>
                
                <p>
                    In 2016, Janusz W. Błaszczyk challenged established beliefs, proposing that PD is a multisystem disorder, where GABAergic decline contributes to dopaminergic depletion in the progression of motor and non-motor symptoms. Numerous studies have since expanded on his claims. <cite class="reflink"><a href="#blaszczyk">Błaszczyk</a></cite>
                </p>
                <p>
                    PD affects multiple neurotransmitter systems beyond dopamine. Dysfunctions in the GABAergic, serotonergic, noradrenergic, and cholinergic systems leads to non-motor symptoms such as depression, anxiety, and cognitive decline. Standard care fails to address this multisystem damage, resulting in poor management of both motor and non-motor symptoms. Instead, a holistic approach that targets all these systems is necessary.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    A comprehensive metastudy published in 2024 confirmed that GABAergic dysfunction disrupts calcium homeostasis, leading to mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress. Restoring GABA activity may preserve mitochondrial health and protect dopaminergic neurons, alleviating both motor and non-motor symptoms in PD. <cite class="reflink"><a href="#alharbi">Alharbi</a></cite>
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    Błaszczyk observed nearly a decade prior that calcium/GABA dysregulation lead directly to dopaminergic neuron loss and neuroinflammation, weakening the BBB. Subsequent research strengthens this assertion, showing this neuroinflammation extends to the glymphatic system and <abbr title="cerebrospinal fluid">CSF</abbr> circulation, furthering PD progression.
                </p>
                
                <h5>GABAergic Dysfunction and Calcium Dysregulation</h5>
                <p>
                    GABAergic dysfunction disrupts motor control, exacerbating calcium dysregulation, leading to prolonged excitatory states in neurons. Excessive calcium influx overwhelms mitochondria, which absorb this excess into the mitochondrial matrix, impairing energy production and triggering oxidative stress. Dopaminergic neurons are highly sensitive to calcium fluctuations and vulnerable to this excitotoxic damage, accelerating degeneration. 
                </p>
                
                <h4>DRT Impact</h4>
                <p>
                     Dopamine Replacement Therapy (DRT) provides temporary symptomatic relief but contributes to long-term neurodegenerative damage by worsening calcium dysregulation. This calcium overload stresses mitochondria, leading to accelerated neurodegeneration. Additionally, DRT depletes vitamin B6, essential for GABA and serotonin production, compounding neurotransmitter imbalances. DRT alone—without addressing the underlying GABA imbalance—overstimulates excitatory pathways, leading to excessive calcium influx into neurons, perpetuating a harmful feedback cycle.
                </p>
                
                <h4>Solutions</h4>
                <p>
                     To reduce reliance on DRT, treatments should aim to address GABAergic collapse and calcium dysregulation. High-dose K2 (5,000 mcg daily) can aid in calcium regulation. Supplementation with GABA and theanine can help restore GABAergic function, with theanine potentially replenishing the neurotransmitter pool of GABA in GABAergic neurons. Cacao, which contains anandamide (an NMDA receptor antagonist reduced in PD), may help mitigate excitotoxicity. Cholinergics can stabilize the plasma membrane and reduce excessive calcium influx, while mitochondrial enhancers like CoQ10, PQQ, and NAD+ boosters restore mitochondrial health and energy balance, alleviating the effects of calcium overload.

                        Alpha-synuclein aggregation in the GI tract may precede motor symptoms. Misfolded α-synuclein can propagate from the enteric nervous system (ENS) in the gut to the brain via the vagus nerve, creating a direct link between the gut and the central nervous system (CNS). This pathway, part of the Braak hypothesis, suggests that α-synuclein pathology may start in the gut before reaching the brain. <cite class="reflink"><a href="#h-braak">Braak</a>, <a href="#y-chao">Chao</a></cite>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Braak's seminal discovery led to imaging studies showing that α-synuclein pathology affects large parts of the peripheral nervous system which may further implicate the gut-brain pathway in PD progression, and sonographic studies have confirmed vagal nerve atrophy, supporting gut-brain pathway in PD progression. <cite class="reflink"><a href="#schaeffer">schaeffer</a></cite>

                        Neurotransmitters, including dopamine, serotonin, and GABA, are also produced in the gut, affecting mood, sleep, and GI health. Impaired gut health reduces neurotransmitter production, worsening PD symptoms. Rstoring gut health may improve upon these symptoms. A preliminary 2020 study out of Nanjing Medical University found that colonic fecal (<abbr title="fecal microbiota transplantation">FMT</abbr>) improved sleep, anxiety, and depression, showing that improving gut health can lead to improved health and symptoms in PD.

                        Alpha-synuclein pathology can propagate bidirectionally between the gut and brain, via the vagus nerve or the bloodstream, depending on individual factors. GI symptoms, such as constipation, often precede motor symptoms by years, indicating that the gut may be an early site of PD pathology. <cite class="reflink"><a href="#klann">Klann</a>, <a href="#arotcarena">Arotcarena</a></cite>

                    <h5>Brain Waste Management Systems (BWMS)</h5>
                    <p>
                        The brain's waste management systems (BWMS) defined herein describes the coordinated systems of interdependent intracellular and extracellular components that protect the brain from harmful substances, clear waste, and maintain homeostasis. 
                    </p>
                    
                    <h6>Intracellular Clearance: UPS and ALP</h6>
                    <p>
                        Intracellular clearance mechanisms include the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) and autophagy-lysosomal pathway (ALP) introduced previously. 
                    </p>
                    <h6>Extracellular Clearance</h6>
                    <p>
                        Extracellular clearance mechanisms include brain phagocytes, the blood-brain barrier (BBB), choroid plexus, CSF, glymphatic system, perivascular spaces, extracellular matrix (ECM), basement membrane. Dysfunction in any of these subsystems leads to α-synuclein aggregation, inflammation, and mitochondrial damage, which impacts other interdependent subsystems, leading to the accumulation of junk proteins and Lewy bodies. Various interventions can improve the integrity and function of these components, with measurable effects. <cite class="reflink"><a href="#solar">Solár</a></cite>
                    </p>
                    
                    <h5>Impact of Dysfunction</h5>
                    <p>
                         When these systems are overwhelmed, their impairment leads to neuronal damage and overburdens interconnected systems, resulting in further dysfunction. For example, α-synuclein fibrils resist breakdown, overloading the <abbr title="ubiquitin proteasome system">UPS</abbr> and <abbr title="autophagy-lysosomal pathway">ALP</abbr>. This results in extracellular waste accumulation, which strains brain phagocytes and other clearance mechanisms.
                    </p>
					<p>
						Normally, smaller misfolded proteins (like α-synuclein) are cleared by the <abbr title="ubiquitin proteasome system"><abbr title="ubiquitin proteasome system">UPS</abbr></abbr>. However, the proteasomes in the UPS can't digest larger, insoluble aggregates that α-synuclein forms over time. In PD, mutant or aggregated α-synuclein resists lysosomal degradation, disrupting autophagy and causing the toxic accumulation of cellular waste. As autophagy fails, oxidative stress and inflammation increase, leading to mitochondrial damage and cell death.
					</p>
                    <p>
                         Microglia and astrocytes clear extracellular α-synuclein aggregates through phagocytosis. In PD, chronic neuroinflammation impairs this process, worsening protein clearance deficits. Increased BBB permeability compounds the problem, allowing contaminants and inflammatory substances to enter and harm the brain. These substances can accumulate in the CSF, further damaging the choroid plexus and disrupting CSF homeostasis, amplifying the strain on all of these interdependent clearance systems.
                    </p>    
                    
                    <h5>The Blood–Brain Barrier (BBB)</h5>
                    <p>
                        The BBB is a protective layer of specialized cells that line the blood vessels of the central nervous system (CNS) in the brain, controlling what enters and exits the <abbr title="central nervous system">CNS</abbr> to maintain homeostasis, allowing necessary nutrients and oxygen to pass through while blocking toxins, pathogens, and other harmful substances.
                    </p>
        
                    <h5>Choroid Plexus and CSF</h5>
                    <p>
                        The choroid plexus is a plexus of cells, a self-contained, functional unit located within the ventricles responsible for secreting <abbr title="cerebrospinal fluid">in the </abbr> and forming a blood-CSF barrier. It consists of a layer of epithelial cells surrounding a core of capillaries and loose connective tissue. As CSF circulates through the brain, it transports essential substances such as nutrients, growth factors, hormones, proteins, electrolytes, and neurotransmitters, while also collecting waste products, including misfolded proteins like α-synuclein. The waste-laden CSF is then drained through specialized pathways, including the ventricles and the glymphatic system, before being filtered out by the liver and kidneys. Damage to the choroid plexus can impair CSF production, disrupt waste clearance, and reduce the transport of essential substances, potentially contributing to cognitive decline.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Damage to the choroid plexus impairs CSF production and disrupts waste clearance, allowing α-synuclein to accumulate, clog, and damage its epithelial cells. This accumulation hinders the brain's ability to clear waste and deliver essential nutrients and growth factors, exacerbating neuroinflammation. <cite class="reflink"><a href="#albachari">Al-Bachari</a>, <a href="#saunders">Saunders</a>, <a href="#tadayon">Tadayon</a></cite>

                                Choroid Plexus — a highly vascularized tissue located in each ventricle of the brain that secretes CSF.

                    <h5>Ventricles</h5>
                    <p>
                        The ventricles are interconnected cavities within the brain filled with CSF. This fluid eventually moves into small structures called arachnoid granulations, tiny, finger-like extensions of the brain’s protective membrane. These granulations help reabsorb CSF into the bloodstream through the dural venous sinuses surrounding the brain, from where it is carried away by the internal jugular veins. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The ventricles circulate and hold CSF and passively drain waste-laden CSF. However, the glymphatic system actively extends <em>through</em> brain tissue to clear waste directly from within the brain and distribute nutrients and neurotransmitters throughout the brain.
                    </p>
                    
                    <h5>The Glymphatic System</h5>
                    <p>
                        The glymphatic system is a dual-purpose pathway that transports nutrients and growth factors and also performs brain-specific waste clearance.
                    </p>
                       
                    <p>
                    	These glial cells remove metabolic waste and toxins, including misfolded proteins like α-synuclein, using CSF to flush out waste from the brain along perivascular spaces (areas surrounding arteries and veins), similar to the body's lymphatic system, hence the term "glymphatic" (glial + lymphatic). Its essential function is compromised in neurodegenerative diseases, including PD.
                    </p>
                    <h6>How it Works</h6>
                    <p>
                        The glymphatic system moves CSF from the space around the brain into brain tissue, where it mixes with interstitial fluid (fluid between brain cells) to clear waste like misfolded proteins. This waste is then carried along the spaces surrounding blood vessels and drained into the deep cervical lymph nodes in the neck for filtration and removal by the body's lymphatic system.
                    </p>
                    
                    <h5 id="protein-clearance-pathway-dysfunction">Protein Clearance Pathway Dysfunction</h5>

                    <h6>Ubiquitin-Proteasome System (UPS) Dysfunction</h6>
                    <p>
                        The UPS degrades smaller, soluble misfolded or damaged proteins by tagging them with ubiquitin and directing them to proteasomes for breakdown. In PD, UPS dysfunction leads to α-synuclein accumulation, which overwhelms other waste clearance pathways and triggers oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, and neurodegeneration.
                    </p>

                    <h6>Autophagy-Lysosomal Pathway</h6>

                    <p>
                        When α-synuclein aggregates are too large for the UPS, they are targeted for autophagic degradation. As noted earlier in the <a href="#alpha-synuclein-clearance">Alpha-Synuclein Clearance Mechanisms</a> section, autophagosomes form around these aggregates, isolating them from the rest of the cellular environment. The autophagosome then fuses with a lysosome, forming an autolysosome that degrades the aggregated proteins within the autophagosome.
                    </p>
                    
					<p>
						<dfn>autophagosome</dfn> — (<dfn>auto</dfn> — "self" + <dfn>phago</dfn> — "eat; consume" + <dfn>some</dfn> — "body") — temporary intracellular structure that engulfs damaged components and delivers them to lysosomes, which act as the cell's recycling centers.
					</p>
                    <p>
                        However, in PD, lysosomal degradation becomes impacted, disrupting autophagy and causing the toxic accumulation of cellular waste. As autophagy fails, oxidative stress and inflammation increase, leading to mitochondrial damage and cell death. This accumulation contributes to extracellular waste, overburdening phagocytes and the glymphatic system, worsening neurodegeneration.
                    </p>

                    <h6>Brain Phagocytes</h6>
                    <p>
                        As mentioned earlier, the lysosomal system in autophagy helps neurons degrade internal misfolded proteins like α-synuclein. Lysosomes also assist phagocytes in clearing extracellular waste. While neurons use autophagy to clear intracellular waste, brain phagocytes, such as microglia and astrocytes, use lysosomal phagocytosis to clear <em>external</em> waste.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                        Brain phagocytes, including microglia, astrocytes, and macrophages, clear cellular debris and toxic proteins. Microglia, the primary phagocytes, engulf damaged neurons, dead cells, and toxic proteins. Astrocytes help clear apoptotic cells (cells dying in a controlled manner) and excess neurotransmitters, supporting microglia in debris removal. Macrophages, present in the perivascular space, also perform phagocytosis, though they are less involved than microglia. 
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                        Phagocytes perform the initial cleanup, breaking down harmful proteins like α-synuclein within themselves, with the remainder either recycled or expelled for further clearance. The glymphatic system helps by flushing extracellular waste from the brain via <abbr title="Cerebrospinal fluid">CSF</abbr>.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                        In PD, misfolded α-synuclein accumulation triggers neuroinflammation, impairing phagocytosis and worsening α-synuclein aggregation. This neuroinflammation impairs phagocytosis, which in turn exacerbates α-synuclein aggregation. This buildup of α-synuclein leads to further aggregation, oligomerization, and fibrillization, forming Lewy bodies and advancing neurodegeneration and senescent cells. Additionally, collagen cross-linking caused by advanced glycation endproducts (AGEs) from high blood sugar, oxidative stress, or chronic inflammation further impairs phagocytosis.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Cells, impacted by this toxicity, become senescent, not functioning but failing to die and impairing phagocytic function and blocking extracellular waste clearance pathways. This leads to a feedback loop where more toxic proteins accumulate, increasing neuroinflammation and mitochondrial damage.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Health strategies that promote collagen formation and support the <abbr title="extracellular matrix">ECM</abbr> may help counteract the effects and degradation of the BBB. Promoting <abbr title="extracellular matrix">ECM</abbr> stability and collagen synthesis contributes to maintaining the structural integrity of the BBB and reduces its permeability to harmful substances, thereby mitigating a <em>major</em> etiological pathway of PD.

                    <p>
                        These include HRT, DHEA, pregnenolone, Growth hormone (GH) and secretagogues (tesamorelin, CJC-1295), collagen peptides (especially collagen type IV), hyaluronic acid, vitamin C, tocotrienols, vitamin K2, vitamin D3, PQQ, beta-glucan (from mushrooms), <abbr title="Mesenchymal signalling cells">MSCs</abbr>, photobiomodulation, and last but not least, intense exercise.

                    <h6>Improving the Ubiquitin Proteasome System (UPS) and Autophagy-Lysosome Pathway (ALP)</h6>
                    <p>
                        Exercise, fasting, caloric restriction, and compounds like trehalose promote autophagy by enhancing cellular stress responses. mTOR inhibitors (such as rapamycin) reduce inhibitory signals on autophagy, increasing the clearance of misfolded proteins. Lithium helps stimulate autophagy and protects against neurodegeneration. Senolytics eliminate senescent cells that impair waste clearance. Mitochondrial enhancers, including Urolithin A and NAD+ boosters, support cellular energy production, further improving <abbr title="ubiquitin proteasome system">UPS</abbr> and <abbr title="autophagy-lysosomal pathway">ALP</abbr> efficiency. 
                    </p>
                    
                    <h6>Strengthening Brain Phagocytes</h6>
                    
                    <p>
                        Addressing the root cause—α-synuclein aggregation—addresses the primary disruption in phagocytosis, which in turn reduces neuroinflammation and limits neuronal damage. Reducing α-synuclein aggregation should be considered a first line of prevention to improve brain phagocytosis.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                        Other health strategies to improve brain phagocytosis include reducing neuroinflammation, increasing blood flow, and increasing neurotrophins. These include supplementing DHA, beta-glucan (from mushrooms), lion's mane, cordyceps, turmeric, ginseng, creatine, EGCG (matcha), ALCAR, phosphatidylserine, tocotrienols, and senolytics. Pyridoxamine (vitamin B6) and aminoguanidine can reduce collagen cross-linking. Growth hormone (GH) and secretagogues (tesamorelin, CJC-1295) photobiomodulation and physical exercise increase neurotrophins. Mesenchymal signaling cells reduce neuroinflammation. 
                    </p>
                    
                    <h6>Increasing CSF Production</h6>
                    <p>
                        Cholinergics and related supplements can support brain function and potentially influence cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) production. Higher choline levels can improve membrane integrity and fluidity, improve BBB integrity and cellular function, and might indirectly support glymphatic system performance.
                    </p>
                    
                    <h6>Do interventions targeting collagen/<abbr title="extracellular matrix">ECM</abbr> strengthen the glymphatic system?</h6>
                    <p>
                        Yes, interventions that improve the health of the <abbr title="extracellular matrix">ECM</abbr> and strengthen collagen may have a beneficial effect on the structural support around blood vessels and thus support glymphatic function. The <dfn title="the areas surrounding blood vessels">perivascular spaces</dfn> which direct CSF flow in the glymphatic system, rely on the surrounding ECM for waste clearance. In PD, these spaces enlarge, reducing waste clearance efficiency. Restoring collagen and ECM health should reduce the size of the perivascular spaces, improving glymphatic function and waste clearance of α-synuclein.
                    </p>

                <h4>Mitochondrial Dysfunction</h4>
                
                <p>
                    Mitochondrial dysfunction is a primary problem in PD. Disrupted energy production, increased oxidative stress, and calcium imbalances all worsen neurodegeneration. This section explores how these mitochondrial dysfunctions accelerate disease progression along with targeted strategies to support mitochondrial resilience, reduce oxidative damage, and improve cellular stability in PD.
                <p>
                <p>
                    Damage to mitochondria can cause α-synuclein aggregation by disrupting cellular processes and increasing oxidative stress. Mitochondria, the <q>powerhouse of the cell</q>, produce ATP, the <q>energy currency of the cell</q>. When mitochondria are impaired, energy production drops and oxidative stress rises, damaging neurons. This creates a cycle where disrupted cellular processes cause protein misfolding and aggregation, which worsens oxidative stress, recursively accelerating mitochondrial dysfunction and neurodegeneration. <cite class="reflink"><a href="#daley">Daley</a></cite>
                </p>
                
                <h5>Mitochondrial Dysfunction and Waste Clearance</h5>
                <p>
                    Mitochondrial dysfunction, coupled with impaired mitophagy, the process of mitochondrial degradation and recycling, allows dysfunctional mitochondria to accumulate, leading to cellular senescence. Senescent cells release reactive oxygen species (ROS) and inflammatory cytokines, which damage neighboring cells and promote neurodegeneration. This cycle accelerates the buildup of misfolded proteins like α-synuclein and impairs essential processes like autophagy and mitophagy, exacerbating neurodegeneration.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    Mitochondrial dysfunction impairs the brain's waste management systems (<abbr title="Brain Waste Management System">BWMS</abbr>), including the <abbr title="ubiquitin proteasome system">UPS</abbr> and <abbr title="autophagy-lysosomal pathway">ALP</abbr>, leading to an accumulation of misfolded proteins. Improving mitochondrial health reduces oxidative stress and supports waste clearance, helping to break the cycle of neurodegeneration.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Improving mitochondrial health decreases the amount of this waste burden and reduces the damage to the systems that remove it, thereby improving the clearance of waste from the brain.
                </p>
                
                <h5>Mitochondrial DNA Damage</h5>
                <p>
                    Mitochondrial DNA damage further impairs function. Ineffective autophagy and mitophagy fail to remove damaged mitochondria and proteins, leading to the formation of senescent cells. These senescent cells resist lysosomal degradation due to protein aggregation, worsening cellular damage. <cite class="reflink"><a href="#korolchuk">Korolchuk</a></cite>
                </p>
                
                <h5>Brain Inflammation</h5>
                <p>
                    Chronic brain inflammation, also known as <dfn title="Chronic, low-grade brain inflammation characterized by upregulation of pro-inflammatory pathways in glial cells, such as astrocytes and microglia">neuroinflammaging</dfn>, is a state of neuroinflammation and immunosenescence, a chronic, low-grade inflammatory state. This chronic, low-grade inflammatory state is both a consequence and a driver of mitochondrial dysfunction. Mitochondrial damage contributes to neuroinflammaging, while the resulting inflammation can further impair mitochondrial function, creating a vicious cycle that accelerates neurodegenerative processes.

                <h5 id="mitochondrial-calcium-dysregulation">Mitochondrial Calcium Dysregulation</h5>
                <p>
                    Besides producing energy, mitochondria help regulate calcium levels in nerve cells by acting as a “buffer", absorbing excess calcium to maintain proper neuron function. Calcium is essential for neuron signaling; however, neurons are particularly sensitive to calcium levels, and its excess can be toxic. Learning about excess calcium can help inform options for testing and managing it, as described further in this section.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Mitochondria regulate cellular calcium to prevent mitochondrial permeability transition pore (mPTP) opening, a process that leads to to cell death, particularly in neurodegenerative diseases like PD. Calcium dysregulation in mitochondria exacerbates oxidative stress, disrupting ATP production and causing neuronal damage.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Excess intracellular calcium occurs through three main pathways. First, channels at the cell surface (<abbr title="voltage-gated calcium channels">VGCCs</abbr>) allow calcium inside. Second, the mitochondrial calcium uniporter (MCU) regulates calcium entry directly into mitochondria for safe storage. Third, the inositol triphosphate receptor (IP3R) moves calcium from the cell’s internal stores into mitochondria. In Parkinson’s Disease, damaged mitochondria lose their ability to manage this calcium effectively, which leads to overload, energy issues, and cell death. In PD and similar conditions, mitochondrial damage (due to oxidative stress and other issues) and excess calcium disrupts the <abbr title="mitochondrial calcium uniporter">MCU</abbr>’s function, leading to uncontrolled, excess calcium uptake and an opening of the <abbr title="mitochondrial permeability transition pore">mPTP</abbr>, leading to neuronal death.
                </p>


                <p>
                    High calcium levels outside cells—often due to supplementation—can trigger the <abbr title="inositol triphosphate receptor">IP3R</abbr> pathway, which further transports calcium from the <abbr title="endoplasmic reticulum">ER</abbr> to the mitochondria. This further overloads mitochondria, reducing ATP production and eventually triggering cell death. 
                </p>

                <h6>Hormonal Loss and Calcium Supplementation (Warning)</h6>
                
                <p>
                    Hormonal loss, often occurring with age, disrupts calcium handling in both men and women. However, postmenopausal women face an increased risk of calcium imbalance, exacerbated by the common healthcare recommendation to supplement calcium. Rather than relying on calcium supplementation, focusing on bone strength through targeted exercise and supportive nutrients that promote calcium uptake into bones may offer a safer and more effective approach. 
                </p>
                
                <h6>Blood Calcium Tests and Intracellular Calcium Levels</h6>
                <p>
                    While standard blood calcium tests measure calcium in the bloodstream, they do not indicate levels within neurons or mitochondria. Discussing options like calcium imaging with a healthcare provider can offer insight into calcium levels specific to cellular and mitochondrial health.
                </p>
                
                <h6>Solutions to Calcium Dyregulation</h6>
                <p>
                    The understated problem of calcium dyregulation is only worsened by the dearth of solutions. Pharmaceutical <abbr title="voltage-gated calcium channels">VGCC</abbr> blockers (L-type) have been proposed <cite class="reflink"><a href="#ntetsika">Ntetsika</a></cite>, however, those come with side effects and worse, clinical trials (STEADY III) results have been poor. A more comprehensive solution to addressing calcium management is in order.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Excess intracellular calcium can be managed with natural (non-pharmaceutical) <abbr title="voltage-gated calcium channels">VGCC</abbr> (L-type) blockers, <abbr title="inositol triphosphate receptor">IP3R</abbr> modulators, and osmolytes, as well as by reducing excess extracellular calcium, which contributes to excess intracellular calcium (via the  <abbr title="inositol triphosphate receptor">IP3R</abbr> pathway). Excess extracellular calcium can be reduced by stimulating bone uptake of calcium. See the Calcium Dysregulation solutions in the <a href="#problems-list">problems list</a> for more. 
                </p>
                 
                <h6>Calcium AKG vs Strontium — Which to Supplement?</h6>
                <p>
                    Calcium supplementation puts one at risk of calcium excess. Calcium alpha-ketoglutarate (Ca-AKG) assists with calcium regulation and improves mitochondrial function (it also reduces inflammation) <cite class="reflink"><a href="#zimmermann">Zimmermann</a>, <a href="#zimmermann">Gyanwali</a></cite>. In PD, where mitochondrial health is compromised, Ca-AKG at ~500 mg per day along with 250 mg strontium citrate and other aforementioned bone-supportive supplements, offers a more comprehensive and safer option. Strontium, while structurally similar to calcium, does not overload mitochondria in the same way, offering superior support without increased mitochondrial stress. Individual needs may vary, and patients should discuss this approach with their healthcare provider to determine the most appropriate dose and evaluate personal calcium needs beyond blood tests alone. 
                </p>

                <h6>Osmolytes</h6>
                <p>
                    Osmolytes help maintain a stable environment within cells by balancing water and ion concentrations, preventing mitochondrial overloads of calcium and other ions that can stress the cell. Common osmolytes include glycine, taurine, and betaine, as well as the electrolyte chloride, which together help stabilize cellular and mitochondrial environments by managing calcium and other ion concentrations.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Mitochondrial dysfunction, in the greater context of PD, also disrupts GABA-producing neurons, impairing GABAergic signaling. As GABA function declines, calcium influx increases, causing abnormal neuronal firing and excitotoxicity, accelerating neurodegeneration, contributing to disease progression. <cite class="reflink"><a href="#matuz-mares">Matuz-Mares</a></cite>
                </p>
                
                <h5>Reactive Oxygen and Nitrogen Species (RONS)</h5>
                <p>
                    Mitochondrial dysfunction and Reactive Oxygen and Nitrogen Species (RONS) can cause α-synuclein to misfold and aggregate, forming toxic mutant species. Combined with calcium dysregulation and inflammation, this toxic α-synuclein contributes to neuronal death and the pathology of PD.

                <p>
                    Several strategies discussed in this document can improve mitochondrial function. These include growth hormone (GH) and secretagogues, vitamin C, tocotrienols, creatine, vitamin K2, vitamin D3, PQQ, beta-glucan, NAD+ and precursors, NAC, and many others detailed in this document.

                    Photobiomodulation, intermittent fasting, sauna, and cold plunges all improve mitochondrial function. <cite class="reflink"><a href="#toro">Toro</a>, <a href="#hunt">Hunt</a>, <a href="#n-chung">Chung</a></cite>
                </p>
                <p>
                    An exercise routine focused on HIIT can fight neurodegeneration and increase cerebral blood flow, improving oxygen delivery, increasing neurotrophins and growth factors, and aiding the penetration of exogenous compounds into deeper brain regions where they can exert therapeutic effects. Many substances that improve health also hasten exercise recovery, further optimizing health. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Once a comprehensive health optimization protocol is established, <abbr title="Mesenchymal signalling cells">MSCs</abbr> can be used to stop neuroinflammation and induce healing.

                <h4>Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER) Dysfunction</h4>
                <p>
                    The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) as a cellular organelle primarily responsible for protein folding, lipid synthesis, and calcium storage. The ER and mitochondria communicate closely through structures called mitochondrial-associated <abbr title="endoplasmic reticulum">ER</abbr> membranes (MAMs), which manage the flow of calcium between them. Normally, this interplay between the <abbr title="endoplasmic reticulum">ER</abbr> and mitochondria helps balance cellular energy needs and signaling.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In PD, accumulation of misfolded α-synuclein and other proteins disrupts <abbr title="endoplasmic reticulum">ER</abbr> function, leading to <abbr title="endoplasmic reticulum">ER</abbr> stress. These disruptions in normal ER function compromise protein homeostasis and destabilize <abbr title="mitochondrial-associated ER membranes">MAMs</abbr>, weakening the ER-mitochondria interface and promoting mitochondrial calcium overload. This overload disrupts cellular signaling and contributes to mitochondrial permeability, inflammation, and cell death. <cite class="reflink"><a href="#matuz-mares">Matuz-Mares</a></cite>

                        <dfn>Proteostasis</dfn> is the <q>protein quality control</q> mechanism of the cell, facilitated by <dfn>chaperone</dfn> proteins. <cite class="reflink"><a href="#lautenschlager">Lautenschläger</a></cite>

                    <p> 
                        Chaperone proteins, like <dfn>heat shock protein 70 (Hsp70)</dfn>, help correctly fold and refold proteins, including α-synuclein, reducing misfolding which leads to aggregation. ER stress worsens when these mechanisms are overwhelmed in PD. <cite class="reflink"><a href="#s-hu">Hu</a></cite>

                    <p>
                        Chaperone function can be stimulated by heat exposure from sauna therapy and <a href="#pbm">photobiomodulation</a>, both of which stimulate the production of Hsp70 and other protective proteins. Curcumin, resveratrol, and glycyrrhizin (from licorice root), also increase the expression of chaperones like HSP70. These interventions can improve protein homeostasis, reduce oxidative stress, and aid in the clearance of misfolded proteins.

                        This rodent study showed that the <dfn title="Alpha-53-Thr mutation: point mutation in the human alpha-synuclein (α-synuclein) gene, associated with early-onset familial PD">A53T</dfn> and <dfn title="point mutation in the alpha-synuclein (SNCA) gene associated with autosomal dominant Parkinson’s disease">A30P</dfn> genetic mutations in α-synuclein have an increased propensity to aggregate compared with the wild-type protein, and this shows how mutant α-synuclein contributes to PD.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        They note α-synuclein in PD arose from gene-linkage experiments in familial early-onset Parkinson’s disease, which revealed the A53T mutation.

                <h3>Testing for PD</h3>
                
                <p>
                    Upon clinical diagnosis of PD (via <abbr title="Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale">UPDRS</abbr> score), serious damage has already been done to nerve cells of the substantia nigra. This underscores the importance of early testing and genetic testing. <cite class="reflink"><a href="#f-nouri-emamzadeh">F. Nouri Emamzadeh</a></cite>
                </p>
    
                <p>
                    Alpha-synuclein oligomers are higher in PD patients than in healthy subjects. This can be tested with AlphaSyn-SAA salivary test or Syn-One skin biopsy.
                </p>
                <h3>Early Testing and Diagnosis with AlphaSyn-SAA</h3>
                <p>
                    The AlphaSyn-SAA salivary test measures the levels of salivary alpha-amylase (SAA). The results are used to assess autonomic nervous system activity, particularly sympathetic nervous system activation. This test can, with some margin of error, identify people at risk of developing Parkinson’s disease <em>up to ten years</em> before symptoms appear. 
                </p>
                <h3>Syn-One</h3>
                <p>
                    The Syn-One skin biopsy detects the presence of phosphorylated alpha-synuclein in the skin. This is a much more accurate test than the AlphaSyn-SAA and is usually used as confirmation, rather than a preventive diagnostic.

                    <h4>Genetic Testing</h4>
                    <p>
                        Most cases of Parkinson's Disease are not classified as genetic. Genetic testing for PD is not routinely performed because only about 15% of cases are determined to be genetic. It's a classic <dfn>absence of evidence</dfn> fallacy.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Genetic testing can provide valuable information to guide treatment, as different genetic mutations may affect disease progression and response to therapies.  (See also: <a href="https://www.michaeljfox.org/what-know-about-genetic-testing"

                        All genetic forms of PD should be considered when developing treatment strategies, with the focus varying depending on the specific mutation and its molecular pathway. Healthcare teams are encouraged to discuss genetic testing and its implications for personalized treatment.

                    <p>
                        Children of PD patients should be tested <em>before</em> they exhibit symptoms similar to those of PD. Symptoms may take up to 10 years to present.

                    <p>
                    Genetic testing for these mutations can be done at specialized medical centers and genetic testing companies. Some notable places include:

                    <p>
                        A custom-tailored care plan based on the genetic type of PD will predict the best outcomes.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Effective treatment must approach PD from multiple angles. The review <cite>"Current Therapies in Clinical Trials of Parkinson’s Disease: A 2021 Update"</cite>, provides a fair overview of PD.

        <h3>Etiological and Holistic Approach</h3>
        <p>
            This guide uses an etiological holistic approach. That is, it is comprehensive, evidence-based, and addresses the root causes of PD with care, precision, and skepticism — considerations that should be applied to the veracity of all healthcare claims.

        <h3>How to Build a Supplement Plan</h3>
        <p>
            Supplements and dietary recommendations are components of a comprehensive health program targeting total human performance at the cellular level. This approach focuses not only on physical exercise but also on non-motor aspects such as sleep, cognitive function, and overall well-being. 
        </p>
        
        <p>
            Brief explanations of what the supplements do accompany the plan. The etiological problems they address are detailed under Causes and Risk Factors. Details on each supplement is listed under its respective section. 
        </p>
        <h4>First, Do No Harm</h4>
        <p>
            It should go without saying that, before embarking on a serious plan to improve health, other lifestyle factors must be in order. That means no smoking and no alcohol, as even 1-2 drinks per week reduce cortical thickness and grey matter. Additionally, maintaining good sleep hygiene is essential.
        </p>
        
        <h4>Exercise</h4>
        <p>
            Without regular, strategic exercise, supplementation will have limited benefits. Exercise increases brain blood flow, helping supplements reach targeted areas (among its many other benefits). Conversely, many supplements enhance exercise performance and recovery.  (See also: <a href="#exercise">Exercise</a>) 
        </p>
        
        <p>
            The following general-purpose solution serves as a customizable starting point to address health with PD from multiple angles, targeting each of the underlying <a href="#etiological-solutions">Etiological Problems</a>.
        </p>
        
        <h4>Mixing and Storing Powders</h4>
        
        <p>The mixed powders "Pre-Workout Mix", "Cacao Mix", and "Post-Workout" powders must be made in batches and should be stored in a cool, dry place with a desiccant pack (like silica gel) inside the powder to prevent clumping and contamination (mold). Silica packs commonly shipped with raw powders and supplements can be reused.
        </p>
        
        <h4>Weighing and Mixing Powders</h4>
        <p>
            A sturdy gram scale or reliable, accurate food scale that measures to the nearest 0.01g (10mg) is necessary to ensure accuracy. To help ensure proper ingredient dispersal, mix the smaller ingredients first and blend in the larger ingredients.
        </p>

            The Daily Supplements improve mitochondrial function, support cognitive performance, and address many etiological pathways in PD. Ubiquinol and PQQ improve mitochondrial energy production and biogenesis, CDP-Choline improves dopamine release, supports phospholipid synthesis, strengthens cellular membranes and improves neurotransmitter production. The Active B Complex facilitates methylation and energy metabolism and makes up for some deficits caused by DRT. Nattokinase reduces amyloid fibrils and promotes α-synuclein ubiquitination, supporting proteasomal degradation and autophagy—a problem in PD progression—by regulating protein misfolding and enhancing cellular waste clearance. Vitamin K2 helps prevent vascular calcification and supports mitochondrial function and may indirectly improve neurological function. Berberine improves mitochondrial function, gut-derived L-dopa production, and the ubiquitin-proteasome system, reducing dependency on DRT. Thiamine further enhances mitochondrial energy production and supports neurological health.

        <h5>Instructions for Pre-Workout Mix</h5>
        <p>
            Mix 28g of the powder with water. Add 1-2 tablespoons of FruitFast pomegranate or blueberry concentrate and 2 tbsp Inner Eco Probiotic Coconut Water. Stir thoroughly and consume with morning supplements before primary workout. Store in a cool, dry place to prevent clumping.
        </p>

        <h5>Pre-Workout Mix Benefits</h5>
        <p>
            The Pre-Workout Mix enhances mitochondrial function as well as cognitive and overall health. <abbr title="Uridine Monophosphate">UMP</abbr> improves neurotransmission and synaptic plasticity. NMN and NR increase NAD+ levels, improving mitochondrial energy production. Niacin increases NAD+ and reduces inflammation. Cordyceps boosts ATP production and is neuroprotective and anti-inflammatory. Lion’s Mane promotes neurogenesis, and Trehalose prevents protein aggregation. Taurine is an osmolyte that improves calcium regulation, improves mitochondrial dysfunction, and improves recovery. Inulin, glucomannan, polyphenols, and probiotic coconut water all support gut health, and coffeeberry extract, rich in chlorogenic acids and polyphenols, improves cognitive function through antioxidant mechanisms.
        </p>
	
		<h5>A Note on Fruits Powders</h5>

		<p>
			Blueberries get more cognitive research attention than other berries. This is partly due to their commercial scale and supporting agriculture and marketing. Industry-funded associations (such as the U.S. Highbush Blueberry Council) promote their cognitive benefits, which boosts consumer demand, leading to more studies, which further solidifies blueberries proven cognitive benefits.
        </p>
				
        <p>
			Other berries like Maqui, Aronia, açaí, and elderberry have similar antioxidant benefits, are high in anthocyanins and other bioactive compounds, and may confer cognitive benefits, despite a dearth of research. Powders from Navitas and other reputable brands are great options that compliment effects of blueberries.

        <h5>Pre-Workout Supplements Benefits</h5>
        <p>
            The Pre-Workout Supplements support cognitive function, stamina, and mitochondrial energy, complementing the broader supplement regimen with athletic performance support specifically selected and relevant to PD, with no evidence linking these enhancers to increased dyskinesias. These compounds improve mental clarity, fight fatigue, and reduce stress from exercise. ALCAR and Na-r-ALA support mitochondrial efficiency, while Alpha-GPC aids acetylcholine production without worsening dyskinesias. Vinpocetine and Ginkgo Biloba improve cerebral blood flow, and Salidroside counteracts fatigue by modulating dopamine and serotonin. 
        </p>
        <p> * Note: For Na-r-ALA, pairing with a carbohydrate source, like 3-5g trehalose, is recommended to optimize glucose uptake. The Pre-Workout Mix could be used as a carbohydrate source if additional trehalose is added.

        <h5>Mixing Instructions</h5>
        <p>
        	Combine Small Ingredients First: Begin with the smallest quantities, like Niacin and Cognance Enhanced Bacopa Powder, and mix thoroughly. This ensures even distribution and reduces "hot spots" where one scoop might have a disproportionate concentration of these potent ingredients. Mash clumps with a spoon.
        </p>
        <p>
				Gradually Add Larger Ingredients: Add the medium-sized amounts (e.g., NMN, Sodium Bicarbonate) and mix again.
		</p>
		<p>
			Incorporate Bulk Ingredients Last: Introduce the largest-volume ingredients (e.g., Whey Protein Isolate, Organic Fruits Powder) and mix thoroughly. Use a large container to allow space for even blending.

        <h5>Instructions</h5>
        <p>
            Pre-mix 79 g powder with water. Add a low-sugar probiotic (plain kefir or yogurt, from whole milk) and 1-2 tbsp of FruitFast blueberry or pomegranate concentrate. Consume immediately after exercise (bring it to the gym).
        </p>
        
        <h5>Post-Workout Mix Benefits</h5>
        <p>
            This Post-Workout Mix aids in muscle recovery, reduces brain inflammation, and supports mitochondrial function. Whey protein is an excellent source of cysteine, which supports the production of glutathione, thereby reducing oxidative stress. BCAAs reduce brain inflammation by decreasing excess glutamate, improve exercise recovery, and increase cognitive function in older persons <cite class="reflink"><a href="caldo-silva">Caldo-Silva</a></cite>. NMN and NR boost NAD+ and repair mitochondria. Taurine is senolytic, improves mitochondrial dysfunction, and is an endogenous neuromodulator that acts as an inhibitory neurotransmitter, activating GABA receptors. TMG (Betaine) regulates GABA and glycine, increases glutathione activity, and lowers homocysteine. Turkey Tail, rich in beta-glucan and ergothioneine, supports cognitive function and protects neurons. Collagen peptides support ECM integrity and gray matter. Lion’s Mane stimulates neurogenesis. Sodium bicarbonate helps restore the acid-base balance in the body, following intensive exercise.

        <h3>
            Food
        </h3>

        <p>
            Certain compounds found in food and supplements help protect against neurodegeneration, with some supporting exercise performance and others improving sleep. Some are synergistic, and some require dietary fats, like eggs or coconut oil, for absorption. This section explores dietary choices, treating food as medicine for PD.
        </p>
        
        <h3>
             Dietary Strategies for Parkinson's Disease
        </h3>
        <p>
            A diet for PD should prioritize gut health, blood sugar control, and the inclusion of bioactives that aid disease management.
        </p>
        <p>
            To manage blood glucose, eliminate all refined sugars, reduce starch intake, and include protein (whey protein post-workout; glycine at night). Fats rich in <abbr title="medium chain triglycerides">MCTs</abbr>, like coconut oil, provide an efficient energy source for the brain and improve the absorption of fat-soluble compounds such as turmeric.
        </p>
        
        <h4>When Protein Increases Glutathione</h4>
        <p>
            
        </p>
        <p>
        
        </p>
        <h4>Eliminating Sugar</h4>
        <p>
            Gut health can be improved by diet. Eliminating refined sugars, especially fructose and sucrose, is an important first step to improving gut health and blood glucose. Dietary sugar alters gut microbiota, leading to endotoxemia (leaky gut), low-grade systemic inflammation, metabolic dysregulation, with many downstream health effects. <cite class="reflink"><a href="#satokari">R. Satokari</a></cite>
        </p>
        
        <h4>Probiotics, Fiber, and Polyphenols</h4>
        <p>
             Fermented foods like yogurt and kimchi, prebiotic fibers like inulin and glucomannan, and polyphenols in foods all promote the production of beneficial short-chain fatty acids and postbiotics, which improve gut health and help regulate appetite.
        </p>
        
        <p>
             Polyphenols, fermentation byproducts, bioactive peptides, and organic acids enhance gut health and short-chain fatty acid (<abbr title="short-chain fatty acid">SCFA</abbr>) production through various mechanisms. These mechanisms include promoting prebiotic activity, supporting beneficial bacteria growth, and beneficial fermentation byproducts and organic acids. This synergistic effect supports a balanced gut microbiome, improves digestive health, and enhances overall well-being. <cite class="reflink"><a href="#x-wang">X. Wang</a></cite>
        </p>
        
        <h4>Polyphenols and SCFAs</h4>
        <p>
            <abbr title="short-chain fatty acid">SCFA</abbr>s are fatty acids with fewer than six carbons, produced by fermenting indigestible fibers in the gut. Polyphenols, like <abbr title="Epigallocatechin gallate">EGCG</abbr> from green tea, increase SCFA production. This reduces gut inflammation and strengthens the colon barrier, which can help prevent enteritis. <cite class="reflink"><a href="#z-wu">Z. Wu</a></cite>
        </p>
        
        <p>
            SCFAs maintain the gut lining and nourish beneficial bacteria. Dietary fiber, fermented by gut bacteria, is the primary source of SCFAs. These fatty acids help regulate appetite, reduce cravings for sugary foods, and improve blood glucose and insulin sensitivity. Lower inflammation further enhances metabolic health. <cite class="reflink"><a href="#xiong">R. Xiong</a>, <a href="#c-de-luca">C. de Luca</a></cite>
        </p>
        
        <h4>Food and the Gut-Brain Axis in Parkinson's Disease</h4>
                
        <p>
            Restoring balance to the gut microbiome through probiotics and prebiotics can improve gastrointestinal function. In PD, gut issues are common, and addressing them may slow neurodegeneration.
        </p>
        <p>
            Recent research has explored the use of probiotics in PD, including constipation, endothelial health, and the gut-brain axis. A 2022 study titled <q>Role of Microbiota-Gut-Brain Axis in Regulating Dopaminergic Signaling</q> found that gut microbiota help maintain adequate concentrations of dopamine via bidirectional communication along the gut-brain axis. <cite class="reflink"><a href="#s-romano">S. Romano</a>, <a href="#a-h-tan">A.H. Tan</a>, <a href="#hamamah">Hamamah</a></cite>
        </p>

        <h4>Insulin Resistance (IR) in PD</h4>
        <p>
            According to a 2018 study, nearly 60% of non-diabetic PD patients may have undiagnosed insulin resistance, despite having normal blood sugar levels. And although higher body mass index (BMI) was associated with increased IR, even lean PD patients showed a higher percentage (41%) of IR compared to healthy adults without PD.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            Studies have consistently shown that individuals with PD exhibit alterations in their gut microbiome, characterized by reduced diversity and altered composition compared to healthy individuals. This dysbiosis may contribute to the development and progression of PD symptoms.

            </li>
            <li>Carbohydrates: ~9-13g</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h6>Cooking Instructions</h6>
        <p>
            Sautée 4-6 oz organic mushrooms (3-10 shiitake, wood ear, button mushrooms) for 10 minutes with one pre-soaked long pepper (piper longum) in 2 tsp coconut oil. Add 2-5 free-range eggs with 1-2 cloves organic garlic and cook lightly on medium heat for a short duration for runny yolks, to minimize fat oxidation. Remove from heat. Add 1.5g of turmeric, 2 tbsp dried organic parsley 2 oz fresh organic broccoli sprouts, 10 threads of saffron, and 2g of powdered natto. Drizzle enough high-DHA fish oil to provide 2,000 - 5,000 mg of DHA.
        </p>

        <p>
            For the DHA, 1 tsp of <q>Wiley's Finest Wild Alaskan Fish Oil Summit DHA Liquid - 2140mg of DHA</q> (providing ~2,140 mg DHA), or 2 tbsp of <q>Nordic Naturals Children's DHA</q> (providing approximately 2,040 mg DHA per tablespoon).
        </p>

        <h6>Egg Scramble with Mushrooms Benefits</h6>
        <p>
            This meal supports brain health through anti-inflammatory effects from every ingredient. Natto and free-range eggs support mitochondrial function. The eggs and mushrooms provide a source of protein. The fats help absorb fat-soluble compounds in turmeric, saffron, and supplements. Broccoli sprouts provide sulforaphane. Natto provides probiotic Bacillus subtilis for gut health. Alfalfa contains many bioactives, including kaempferol, quercetin, and other anti-inflammatory compounds. DHA in the fish oil supports membrane fluidity, brain structure, neurotransmission, synaptic plasticity, decreased neuroinflammation, mood, and cognitive function. The parsley provides 5-10mg of apigenin (an insufficient amount alone), a senolytic.
        </p>

        <p>
            The caloric and fat ranges are broad due to the flexibility in ingredient choices of eggs and oil type.
        </p>

            <h3>Symptomatic Approach</h3>
            <h5>Gold Standard: Dopamine Agonism</h5>
            <p class="call-out">
                The gold standard for managing PD is symptomatic management via dopamine agonism (<abbr title="Levodopa / Dopa-decarboxylase inhibitors">LD/DDC inhibitors</abbr>, MAO-B inhibitors, and <abbr title="catechol-O-methyltransferase">COMT</abbr> inhibitors). Unfortunately, that leads to other neurological imbalances, causes other nutrient deficiencies, and leads to <abbr title="progressive neurodegeneration">PN</abbr>.
            </p>
            <p>
                Maintaining dopamine levels in the brain helps alleviate motor problems and can reduce fibrillization. However, unilateral dopamine replacement therapy creates some problems. This is because DRT does not address the root cause and in fact contributes to dyskinesias, as discussed further herein.
            </p>
                        
            <p>
                Some doctors may attempt to enhance dopamine function by suppressing the cholinergic system using anticholinergics, but this approach leads to adverse effects.
            </p>
            
        </section>
        
        <section id="disease-progression-approach">
            <h4>Disease-Progression Approach</h4>
            <p>
                Doctors tend to discount the idea of slowing the progression of the disease. Some off-handedly discount supplements and nutrition as "complementary" care without examination. Many of these same doctors once prescribed anticholinergics. (If the doctor falls into that category, finding a new doctor may be advisable.)
            </p>
        </section>
        <section id="etiological-approach">
         <h3>Etiological Approach</h3>
         
        <p>
            Etiological treatments target the underlying causes of disease. These providers address the root causes with scientific rigor however, some may rely on conventional medicine and focus on the disease itself, rather than individual factors and health optimization.
        </p> 
        </section>
        
        <section id="holistic-approach">
            <h3>Holistic Approach</h3>
            <p>
                The holistic approach is patient-centered care that aims to address the underlying causes of disease and promote overall health. However, some holistic providers use implausible or disproven strategies (e.g. homeopathy, reiki, "mind, body, spirit", etc). 
            </p>
        </section>
    <!-- TODO: Move where??
            <h4>The Role of Nutrition</h4>
            <p>
                Nutritional deficiencies can exacerbate symptoms in individuals with PD and may sometimes be mistaken for progressive neurodegeneration. This misinterpretation can lead to inappropriate management strategies if the underlying nutritional issues are not addressed.
            </p>
            <p>
                Furthermore, certain nutrient deficiencies can trigger cascading effects, exacerbating PD symptoms or hasten the decline of the condition. For example, deficiencies in vitamins B12, folate, and vitamin D have been implicated in PD and can affect neurological function and overall health. Inadequate intake of essential nutrients can also impair mitochondrial function, increase oxidative stress, and compromise neurotransmitter synthesis and signaling, all of which are implicated in PD pathophysiology.
            </p>
            <p>
                Additionally, levodopa/carbidopa therapy can reduce vitamin B6 levels, which is essential for the synthesis of neurotransmitters.
            </p>
            <p>
                It's crucial to build a comprehensive plan that strikes a balance between supplementation, nutrition, lifestyle, and regular monitoring to slow disease progression.
            </p>
            <p>
                Don't just "talk to your doctor", collaborate with a team of healthcare professionals with multiple specialties to create individualized treatment plans that include nutrition, lifestyle, supplementation, and medication. Regularly test and monitor status with symptoms and biochemical markers to assess the effectiveness of interventions and make adjustments as needed.
            </p>
            <p>
                <dfn>Antifibrillogenics</dfn> mitigate formation of α-synuclein fibrils. Anti-aggregants aim to prevent the accumulation of fibrils and other misfolded proteins into lewy bodies. By preventing the formation of α-synuclein fibrils and aggregates, these compounds address the underlying pathology of Parkinson's disease at a more fundamental level, potentially offering therapeutic benefits in managing the condition.
            </p>
            <p>
                Preventing fibril aggregation (<dfn>anti-aggregant</dfn>): These treatments focus on inhibiting the aggregation of α-synuclein fibrils into Lewy bodies, potentially slowing the spread of pathology and neurodegeneration.
            </p>
            <p>
                It is necessary to work with doctors who focus on what works. Focus on the facts and evidence, consider risk/reward, and work on total health. Avoid doctors who won't look at the evidence you present them.
            </p>
            
            <h4>What Do Doctors Miss?</h4>
            <p>
                Doctors typically prioritize symptoms over addressing the underlying causes. Specifically, they tend to focus on the dopamine pathway with medications like levodopa/carbidopa, to enhance dopamine levels in the brain, and COMT inhibitors, to inhibit its breakdown by catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT).
            </p>
            <p>
                Approaches to mitigating the underlying cause can extend longevity, improve quality of life, and reduce the dependence on medication which is not without side effects. Address these key areas for a more comprehensive approach to managing PD. (For solutions, see: <a href="#problem-list">Problem List</a>)

            </ul>

            <p>
                Many approaches overlap more than one problem area and have synergistic benefits. For example, 5-HTP is converted into serotonin in the brain. It inhibits the release of glutamate, mitigates oxidation modulates dopamine
                release, improves mitochondrial function, and improves sleep, which improves overall health, leading to a better sense of well-being and better exercise capacity and recovery.

        <h2>Detailed Treatments</h2>
        <section id="medications">
            <h3>Medications</h3>
            
            <h4>Standard of Care Medications</h4>
            <p class="call-out">
                Conventional medicine treats PD with symptomatic management. This includes dopamine replacement therapy (DRT) using Levodopa/Carbidopa  (dopamine precursors), <abbr title="catechol-O-methyltransferase">COMT</abbr> inhibitors and <abbr title="monoamine oxidase B">MAO-B</abbr> inhibitors that prevent dopamine breakdown, and anticholinergics.
            </p>
            
            <h4>Criticism of Standard of Care</h4>
            
            <p>
                Standard pharmacological treatments offer short-term relief of motor symptoms but exacerbate neurotransmitter imbalances, leading to permanent damage. We’ll explore why these limitations persist in healthcare and how to address the underlying problems more comprehensively.
            </p>
                        
            <h4>Shortcomings of Standard Pharmacological Treatments</h4>
            <p>
                <abbr title="dopamine replacement therapy">DRT</abbr>, the gold standard, offers short-term relief of motor symptoms but overlooks multiple problems and underlying etiological pathways.
            </p>
            <p>
                Non-motor symptoms, including cognitive decline, sleep disturbances, and autonomic dysfunction, indicate deeper systemic dysfunction that requires careful attention. Ignoring these symptoms accelerates disease progression, making neurodegeneration a self-fulfilling outcome of DRT-focused treatment.
            </p>
            <p>
                Mitochondrial dysfunction—a major pathology of disease progression—along with neuroinflammation, cellular senescence, α-synuclein pathology, and failure of the brain's waste management systems are all ignored by standard treatments.
            </p>
            <p>
                Aside from temporarily addressing decreased dopamine levels, standard treatments largely overlook these mechanistic issues. Worse, DRT's interaction with α-synuclein contributes to cellular damage and the development of <abbr title="L-Dopa-induced dyskinesias">LIDs</abbr>, further complicating the patient's condition.
            </p>
            
            <h4>Educational and Industry Bias</h4>
            <p>
                Medical school bias towards conventional treatments persists with pharmaceutical influence over leadership, faculty, curricula, and culture <cite class="reflink"><a href="#anderson">Anderson</a></cite>. Students, unaware of this bias, adopt industry-supported ideologies while rejecting other approaches, forming the basis for provider bias.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                According to <a href="https://www.biopharmadive.com/news/who-are-the-22-pharma-board-members-who-also-lead-healthcare-nonprofits/543144/" target="_blank">BioPharma Dive</a>, twelve of the 19 largest pharmaceutical and biotech companies in the world had at least one director simultaneously serving in a leadership position at a nonprofit healthcare organization. Researchers who point out such conflicts of interest on corporate boards risk job security and alienation by colleagues.
            </p>
            
            <h4>Peer Pressure and Not Invented Here (NIH) Syndrome</h4>
            <p>
                Peer pressure in the healthcare community influences medical decision-making. Cultural and professional norms, pharmaceutical influence, and perceived lack of evidence lead to conformity over critical evaluation. Healthcare providers are embedded in a culture that emphasizes adherence to established protocols and guidelines influenced by institutional norms and the broader medical community. This creates a reluctance to deviate from conventional practices, even when proven ineffective or harmful, or when alternative approaches are supported by emerging evidence.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Government policies and regulations shape medical practice, creating conflicts of interest that favor pharmaceutical interests over patient needs. For example, the FDA’s accelerated approval of Aduhelm in 2021, despite mixed trial results, was influenced by Biogen's lobbying.
            </p>
            <p>
                For example, <a href="https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/ng71/chapter/Recommendations#pharmacological-management-of-motor-symptoms" target="_blank">NICE guidelines</a> discourage the use of all over-the-counter supplements, specifically mentioning <a href="#ubiquinol">CoQ10</a>, <a href="#creatine">Creatine</a>, and <a href="#tocotrienols">Vitamin E</a>—which have neuroprotective effects. Simultaneously, they recommend anticholinergics, despite their well-documented negative impact on cognitive function and neuronal integrity <cite class="reflink"><a href="#campbell">Campbell</a>, <a href="#yasumasa">Yasumasa</a></cite>. This shows institutional preference for pharmaceutical solutions over patient-centered care, pushing symptom management through reliance on drugs and missing opportunities for neuroprotection through non-pharmaceutical means.
            </p>

            <p>
                Although DRT is the standard of care used to manage motor symptoms, its over-reliance leads to permanent damage and complications such as motor fluctuations and dyskinesias, which will be discussed further below. These examples show the limitations of standard treatment approaches and the need for strategies that address underlying pathologies, minimize harmful effects, and optimize health. 
            </p>
            
            <h4>Genetic Testing</h4>
            <p>
                Moreover, identifying PD gene mutations, especially in early-onset cases, can provide valuable information for prognosis and can influence treatment decisions, particularly in cases initially suspected to be psychogenic. Despite this, genetic testing is not part of the standard of care. 
            </p>

            <h4>There is Hope!</h4>
            <p>
                There is hope! Understanding the problems is necessary for informed action to address the underlying etiological pathways. The right knowledge and strategy is the key to regaining control over personal health. This guide addresses the etiological pathways overlooked by healthcare with scientific evidence, providing specific approaches to address them.
            </p>
            <p>
                First, we'll cover DRT and its limits. Next, we'll dive deeper into the multisystem dysfunction of PD, including GABA, serotonin, and cholinergic imbalance. Finally, we'll discuss broader therapeutic approaches (holistic strategies that address neurotransmitter imbalance, mitochondrial health, neuroprotection, etc.)

                <section id="drt-introduction">
                    <h3>Dopamine Replacement Therapy (DRT)</h3>
                    <h4>Introduction to DRT</h4>
                    <p>
                        DRT includes levodopa with a decarboxylase inhibitor (LD/DDC inhibitor) to increase dopamine levels in the brain, alleviate motor symptoms, and improve quality of life. This is the gold standard for PD; however, it misses the broader problem of neurotransmitter dysfunction, which ultimately causes more problems. 
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                        This is because PD involves the failure of <em>multiple</em> neurotransmitter systems, including GABA, serotonin, and acetylcholine—not just dopamine. Addressing just the dopaminergic system while neglecting these other systems leads to neurotransmitter imbalance and worsening symptoms over time.

                    <h5>Fibrillization Inhibition</h5>
                    <p>
                        Dopamine initially reacts with α-synuclein to inhibit its fibrillization. This is good, as fibrils contribute to Lewy bodies, cellular damage, senescent cells, and neurodegeneration. <cite class="reflink"><a href="#dorszewska">Dorszewska</a></cite>
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                        Although DRT initially improves motor symptoms, focusing solely on dopamine replacement overlooks broader PD complexities, leading to more problems.
                    </p>
                    
                    <h5>DRT Problems — Is a Multisystem Approach Better?</h5>
                    <p>
                        PD affects multiple neurotransmitter systems, not just the dopaminergic system. Disruptions in the GABAergic, serotonergic, and cholinergic pathways contribute to non-motor symptoms such as depression, anxiety, and cognitive decline. Failing to address these systems leads to imbalanced treatment outcomes.

                    <p>
                        Although DRT raises dopamine levels and alleviates symptoms, it fails to restore GABAergic inhibition within motor circuits. Without proper GABAergic control, excitatory signals persist, leading to motor pathway hyperactivation and dyskinesias.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Cholinergic overactivity worsens rigidity and postural instability in PD, while the loss of GABAergic inhibition exacerbates this imbalance. Treatments targeting both the GABA and acetylcholine pathways are necessary to restore neurotransmission balance.

                    <h5>DRT-induced Gut Dysbiosis</h5>
                    <p>
                        DRT can contribute to gut dysbiosis by altering the gut microbiota's composition and function. In turn, gut dysbiosis can affect dopamine synthesis and breakdown and, worse, exacerbate α-synuclein misfolding, accelerating PD progression <cite class="reflink"><a href="#keshavarzian">Keshavarzian</a></cite>. This is yet another reason to minimize and avoid DRT overreliance over a more comprehensive program that includes gut health.

                    <h5>Delaying DRT vs Holistic Neurotransmitter Balance</h5>
                    <p>
                        Some patients delay DRT to avoid early dyskinesias. However, early intervention targeting GABAergic dysfunction can help manage both motor and non-motor symptoms, providing better symptom control in early-stage PD and greater longevity.

                    <p>
                        The overreliance on DRT to increase dopamine levels without addressing GABAergic dysfunction can result in dyskinesias. Without proper GABAergic inhibition, excitatory signals persist in motor circuits, leading to involuntary movements.

                    <p>
                        Dopamine agonists also deplete active vitamin B6 levels in the body. They do this by irreversibly binding to and permanently deactivating pyridoxal 5’-phosphate (P5P), the active form of vitamin B6. This leads to various side effects and exacerbates the progression of the disease, as B6 is essential for dopamine synthesis and is involved in other metabolic pathways.

                        Dopamine is but one of many neurochemical systems in the midbrain. Focusing solely on the dopaminergic system without considering other neurotransmitter systems leads to progressive neurodegeneration (PN) exacerbating motor and non-motor symptoms.

                    <h5>DRT Summary</h5>
                    <p>
                       Although DRT can significantly improve PD symptoms by raising dopamine levels, overreliance on it without addressing other affected neurotransmitter systems and other etiological factors leads to imbalances and complications, and worsening non-motor symptoms. DRT is powerful but incomplete when used in isolation.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Instead, a comprehensive treatment strategy addressing these systems in conjunction with a more conservative DRT approach can offer better symptom control, particularly in early-stage PD, leading to improved long-term outcomes and longevity. <cite class="reflink"><a href="#mor">Mor</a>, <a href="#thompson">Thompson</a></cite>
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                        DRT should be used at the minimum effective dose (MED). This can be done using a holistic approach to address neuroprotection, neurorestoration, antioxidation, and mitochondrial health. Consider Produodopa for even, continuous dopamine levels with reduced side effects. Also, explore strategies to address multiple neurotransmitter systems and minimize DRT with your care team.

                            <strong>Highlights:</strong> Moreover, we found that SATB1 directly represses the expression of the pro-senescence factor p21 in dopaminergic neurons. Our data implicate senescence of dopamine neurons as a contributing factor in the pathology of Parkinson's disease.

                Hormone replacement therapy (HRT) may offer neuroprotection to improve mobility and mood, cognitive function, and quality of life in both men and women. Risk of developing PD is twice as high in men but is also elevated in women with early menopause. Estrogen and testosterone are both neuroprotective. <cite class="reflink"><a href="#cerri">Cerri</a></cite>

            <h4>Collagen Degradation, BBB Permeability, and α-synuclein</h4>
            <p>
                Estrogen directly affects collagen synthesis and integrity, including connective tissues, including the extracellular matrix (ECM). Loss of estrogen accelerates collagen degradation, weakening the <abbr title="extracellular matrix">ECM</abbr> of the BBB and choroid plexus, making the junctions of these barriers more permeable, and allowing harmful substances, including α-synuclein, to aggregate, form fibrils, and enter the brain. 
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Disease progression might involve distinct pathogenic mechanisms (or the same mechanism but in a different way) in male and female patients, and HRT for men and women may offer benefits. Alternatively, DHEA can also be used in conjunction with or independently of HRT, which, at least for women, may present a lower risk of cancer compared to steroid hormone therapies.
            </p>
            <p>
                Protocols that promote collagen formation and support the <abbr title="extracellular matrix">ECM</abbr> may help counteract the effects of estrogen loss on the brain waste management system, which includes the BBB, choroid plexus, CSF, glymphatic system, and perivascular spaces.

                <h5>Hormone Replacement Therapy (HRT) for Women</h5>
                <p>
                    HRT for women may include estrogens (17 beta-estradiol, estrone, and estriol), progesterone, pregnenolone, and DHEA. <!-- neurologysolutions -->
                </p>
                <h5>Early Menopause: PD and HRT — Estrogen and Progesterone</h5>
                <p>
                    Early menopause is statistically more common in women with PD. Several studies have associated postmenopausal HRT with a reduced risk of PD. Research indicates that women with PD are less likely to have used HRT compared to those without PD. The neuroprotective effects of estrogen replacement have shown positive results in animal models of PD and in early menopausal women with PD. <cite class="reflink"><a href="#l-currie">L. Currie</a>, <a href="#d-brann">D. Brann</a></cite>
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    Women's HRT is primarily aimed at alleviating vasomotor (VMS) and vaginal symptoms, but can also address osteopenia. VMS, related to thermoregulation, involves neuroendocrine, autonomic, and somatosensory systems, and is influenced by serotonergic and noradrenergic neurotransmitter pathways —systems often associated with depression. Dysfunction in these interconnected neurotransmitter systems may contribute to PD development.

                    A 2023 study published in Alzheimer's Research &amp; Therapy found that hormone replacement therapy (HRT) is linked to better memory and increased size of brain areas involved in memory and emotions, but only in people with the <abbr title="Apolipoprotein E allele 4">APOE4</abbr> gene. Since <abbr title="Apolipoprotein E allele 4">APOE4</abbr> is also associated with more α-synuclein buildup in PD, these findings could open new research paths for HRT’s effects on memory and brain structure in PD patients with the <abbr title="Apolipoprotein E allele 4">APOE4</abbr> gene. <cite class="reflink"><a href="#r-saleh">R.

This research found a positive association between estrogen use and lower symptom severity in women with early PD who were not yet taking L-dopa.

                <h5>Osteocalcin — Estrogen's Effects on Osteoblasts</h5>
                <p>
                    Estrogen stimulates osteoblasts, which produce osteocalcin (OCN). OCN is partially modified by vitamin K into carboxylated OCN, while the rest remains undercarboxylated (ucOCN). Carboxylated OCN improves bone strength.
                </p>
                <p>
                     Undercarboxylated OCN acts as a hormone in the body and brain. OCN crosses the blood-brain barrier and has been shown to reach the midbrain and brainstem and influence brain functions such as memory and cognition. <cite class="reflink"><a href="#obri">A. Obri</a></cite>
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    Decreased production of osteocalcin, including its undercarboxylated form, during menopause can reduce neuroprotection and cognitive function.

                <h5>Risks of HRT in Women</h5>
                <p>
                    Estrogen replacement carries risks such as vascular disease and certain cancers, requiring careful medical supervision. Alternatives to increasing osteocalcin levels include high-impact and weight-bearing exercise, and supplementation of vitamin K, magnesium, strontium, collagen, sleep, and vitamin D.

                    A 2023 study explored how progesterone might protect nerve cells in the enteric nervous system (ENS) ("the gut"), which can be affected early in Parkinson’s Disease (PD). Researchers tested nerve cells from rats to see if they had the receptors needed to respond to progesterone. Then, they damaged these cells using <dfn title="1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine — is a protoxin that can cause parkinsonism similar to PD">MPTP</dfn>, a toxin that mimics the damage seen in PD. Progesterone treatment reduced cell death by 45%, indicating a significant protective effect linked to a specific progesterone receptor. The impressive results require further human trials to confirm progesterone's effectiveness in reducing <abbr title="enteric nervous system">ENS</abbr> dysfunction in PD. <cite class="reflink"><a href="#stegemann">Stegemann</a></cite>

                    Combining DHEA with HRT (ERT + progesterone) may offer overall hormone balance, including testosterone and the estrogen to progesterone ratio. This combination may improve bone health and brain function by increasing estradiol and IGF-I, stimulating osteoblasts to release neuroprotective osteocalcin.

                <p>
                    Adding pregnenolone as a DHEA precursor might help optimize hormonal balance, as progesterone is a precursor to many other hormones, including DHEA, progesterone, estrogen, and cortisol, providing more raw material to convert into these hormones as needed.

                <h5>TRT for Men</h5>
                <h4>Testosterone</h4>
                <p>
                    Testosterone has neuroprotective effects. Beyond sexual function, androgens maintain mood and cognition, and also brain efficiency (the brain’s ability to optimize its functioning, processing, and energy consumption), reducing the incidence of dementia. Conversely, its absence may contribute to neurodegenerative processes (Wahjoepramono, et al, cited in Bianchi).
                </p>
                <p>
                Testosterone stimulates neuronal differentiation, thereby maintaining neuronal plasticity, promoting synaptic density, increasing connectivity of hypothalamic neurons, and stimulating neurite outgrowth. <cite class="reflink"><a href="#v-e-bianchi">V.E. Banchi</a></cite>.  A portion of testosterone (~5-10%) is converted to estradiol via aromatase, which contributes to its neuroprotective effects. Raising testosterone to optimal levels (e.g., ~600-800 ng/dL) through TRT may enhance these benefits by increasing estradiol production. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    A 2020 review concluded that TRT offered dose-dependent neuroprotection, reducing neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration. The researchers noted that testosterone improves the survival of human neurons and astrocytes, acting directly on the mitochondrial membrane, inhibiting the generation of <abbr title="Reactive Oxygen and Nitrogen Species">RONS</abbr>, as well as sirtuin-1 expression.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Poor results in some studies can be attributed to flawed designs, particularly the use of testosterone enanthate administered at intervals that exceeded its eight-day half-life, leading to wide fluctuations in testosterone levels. In contrast, stable elevation of total testosterone in men with low testosterone showed improvements in motor and non-motor symptoms of PD. <cite class="reflink"><a href="#okun">Okun</a></cite>
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    Under endocrinologist supervision, raising testosterone levels to the mid-to-upper range of normal (600-900 ng/dL), based on individual needs, may offer neuroprotective and neurological benefits, including improved mood and cognitive function.

            <section id="dhea">
                <h4 class="neuroprotective">Dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA)</h4>
                <p>
                    DHEA, produced by the adrenal glands, ovaries, and brain, converts into hormones such as estrogen, testosterone, and cortisol, which influence various physiological processes like sleep, memory, and stress response.
                </p>
                <p>
                    DHEA's conversion to cholesterol regulation may help manage PD symptoms.
                </p>
                                
                <h5>Blood-Brain Barrier (BBB)</h5>
                <p>
                    DHEA is fat-soluble, allowing it to cross the BBB easily, and is available as a dietary supplement.
                </p>
                
                <h5>Hormonal Effects in Women</h5>
                <h6>IGF-I Levels</h6>
                <p>
                    A 2020 review concluded that estrogen, particularly in women, may help PD by increasing IGF-I levels and activating its signaling pathways, possibly inhibiting aggregation and fibrillization of α‐synuclein. Another 2020 review found that DHEA supplementation may raise IGF-I levels in women and older adults, which could benefit women in early menopause. <cite class="reflink"><a href="#cortazar">Castilla-Cortázar</a>, <a href="#min-xie">Xie</a></cite>
                </p>
                
                <h6>Testosterone and Estradiol Levels</h6>
                <p>
                     A 2021 meta-analysis found that DHEA administration significantly increased testosterone levels and decreased BMI in elderly women, suggesting its hormonal effects. <cite class="reflink"><a href="#y-hu">Y. Hu</a></cite>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Another 2021 meta-analysis found that postmenopausal women 60 years and above on 50 mg/day DHEA for at least 26 weeks had a more pronounced elevation of the circulating estradiol levels. <cite class="reflink"><a href="#y-zhu">Y. Zhu</a></cite>
                </p>
                                
                <p>
                    A 2016 review found a positive correlation between DHEA-S levels and global cognition in both sexes. DHEA-S correlated with working memory, attention, and verbal fluency in women, possibly due to its effects on menopausal cognitive decline. DHEA supplementation increases DHEA-S levels, so it can be expected to have these effects. <cite class="reflink"><a href="#k-menezes">K. Menezes</a>, <a href="#s-vale">S. Vale</a></cite>
                </p>
                
                <h6>Contradicting Symptomatic Evidence</h6>
                
                <p>
                    A 2006 Cochrane study found no improvement in memory or cognitive function in non-demented older adults from DHEA supplements. Subsequent studies, including those mentioned above, however, have shown more promising results. <cite class="reflink"><a href="#j-evans">J. Evans</a></cite>
                </p>    

                <h6>Osteoblast Stimulation</h6>
                <p>
                    A second mechanistic action of DHEA involves its effects on the bone-brain axis. As discussed in the section on IGF-I levels, DHEA's metabolism into estradiol (E2) and other hormones may influence osteoblasts and chondrocytes, contributing to its overall effects.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A 2020 study found that DHEA improved <abbr title="Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale">UPDRS</abbr> scores in  <dfn title="1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine — is a protoxin that can cause parkinsonism similar to PD">MPTP</dfn> monkeys, a model of PD, indicating potential benefits for PD management. <cite class="reflink"><a href="#n-belanger">Bélanger</a></cite>
                </p>
                <p>
                    These results may be partly explained by DHEA signaling osteoblasts and chondrocytes directly and through its metabolites, including E2 and dihydrotestosterone (DHT). Osteoblast stimulation increases osteocalcin levels, which may affect the bone-brain axis and enhance cognitive function.  <cite class="reflink"><a href="#d-kirby">D. Kirby</a></cite>
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    Osteocalcin promotes spatial learning and memory and prevents anxiety-like behavior. This complex interplay between the bones and the central nervous system, influencing each other's function and behavior, is elaborated on under the section on K2 supplementation and elsewhere in the document.
                </p>

                <h5>Supplementation</h5>
                <p>
                    Supplementing with 50-100 mg DHEA may alleviate age-related hormonal declines, improving bone density (especially in older women), skin aging, and mild to moderate depression. It may also help manage menopausal symptoms by raising estradiol levels. Though DHEA was once thought to increase breast cancer risk, recent evidence suggests it may actually inhibit breast cancer cell proliferation and migration. Consult a knowledgeable provider to discuss DHEA supplementation. <cite class="reflink"><a href="#colin-val">Colín-Val</a></cite>
                </p>
                
                <h6>Safer HRT Alternative</h6>
                <p>
                    DHEA and pregnenolone can also be used independently of HRT, which may present a lower risk of cancer compared to steroid hormone therapies.
                </p>

                <h4>Pregnenolone</h4>
                <p>
                    Pregnenolone is a neurosteroid and precursor to various hormones, including cortisol, DHEA, and progesterone. It has been explored as a potential candidate for hormone replacement therapy (HRT) in female reproductive disorders targeting estrogen receptor beta (ERβ) and may improve cognitive function where it has been impaired by elevated blood glucose (in diabetics). <cite class="reflink"><a href="#yy-shin">Shin</a></cite>
                </p>
                <p>
                    A 2022 study on a rodent model of insulin resistance concluded that a short-term diet high in processed foods, refined sugars, and unhealthy fats impairs memory, but this is reversible by pregnenolone, which mediates memory function via the hippocampus. <cite class="reflink"><a href="#s-ramirez">Ramírez</a></cite>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Cholesterol is converted into pregnenolone. Pregnenolone can then be converted into progesterone or DHEA, and DHEA can further be converted into androgens and estrogens. 
                </p>
                
                <h5>Pregnenolone and DRT</h5>
                <p>
                    Pregnenolone reduces levodopa-induced dyskinesias (LIDs) without compromising L-DOPA's motor benefits. The mechanism could be DHEA-S or PREG-S agonism on NMDA receptors to exert an antagonistic activity on <abbr title="γ-Aminobutyric acid type A (GABA[A] ) receptors">GABA-A</abbr> receptors. <cite class="reflink"><a href="#corsi">Corsi</a></cite>
                </p>
                
                <h5>Pregnenolone Dosage</h5>
                <p>
                    Pregnenolone is available as a dietary supplement and is typically safe in doses ranging from 10 to 50 mg per day.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Pregnenolone is fat-soluble and crosses the BBB. Once in the brain, pregnenolone can be converted into other neurosteroids, such as allopregnanolone, which have various effects on neuronal function and behavior.
                </p>                
                <p>
                    Several clinical studies have investigated pregnenolone as a treatment for Parkinson’s disease. One study found that pregnenolone dose-dependently countered <abbr title="L-Dopa-induced dyskinesias">LIDs</abbr> without affecting L-DOPA-induced motor improvements.

                <h4>Growth Hormone and Secretagogues</h4>
                <p>
                    Human growth hormone (GH) stimulates growth, cell repair, and metabolism, and reduces inflammation. <cite class="reflink"><a href="#masternak">Masternak</a></cite>
                </p>
                
                <h5>GH, IGF-1, and MGF</h5>
                <p>
                    GH increases levels of Insulin-like Growth Factor 1 (IGF-1), which can then be further metabolized into Mechano Growth Factor (MGF) in response to mechanical stimuli, such as intense exercise. Mechano-growth factor is neuroprotective. (GH stimulates the liver to produce IGF-1. IGF-1 is further metabolized into MGF through alternative splicing of IGF-1 mRNA by lactate and other stress signals.)
                </p>

                <h5>Brain Waste Management System (BWMS), Collagen, and IGF-I</h5>
                <p>
                    IGF-1 promotes collagen synthesis by fibroblasts, which strengthens connective tissues, including those in the BBB and choroid plexus. Increased collagen production enhances the function and structural integrity of the brain waste management system (BWMS), reducing permeability and improving waste clearance through several coordinated mechanisms of the BWMS.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    IGF-1 increases the synthesis of <abbr title="extracellular matrix">ECM</abbr> proteins beyond collagen, such as proteoglycans and glycosaminoglycans, which contribute to the structural framework of tissues. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Growth and repair of the choroid plexus, where CSF is produced, improve its functioning. Increased CSF production enhances waste clearance by increasing the volume of fluid available to remove metabolic byproducts and harmful substances from the brain. 
                </p>
                
                <p>
                     Lower inflammation may improve the function of the choroid plexus and its ability to produce CSF.
                </p>
                
                <h5>Gh Secretagogues CJC-1295 and Tesamorelin</h5>
                <p>
                    Growth hormone secretagogues, such as tesamorelin and CJC-1295, are peptides that stimulate the secretion of GH. The increase in GH levels from these secretagogues is generally less pronounced compared to direct GH injections.
                </p>
                
                <h5>Side Effects</h5>
                <p>
                    Blood glucose control and hyperglycemia are known side effects of growth hormone. Potential side effects at higher doses may include joint pain, insulin resistance, and swelling. It is important to monitor for these effects and consult a healthcare provider. <cite class="sigalos"><a href="#masternak">Sigalos</a></cite>

            <h3>Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS)</h3>
            <p>
                Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS) uses electrodes implanted in the brain to deliver electrical impulses to the globus pallidus internus (GPi). This helps to regulate brain activity.
            </p>
            
            <h4>LRRK2-G2019S and DBS</h4>
            <p>
                <abbr title='Leucine-Rich Repeat Kinase 2 gene with a glycine to serine substitution at position 2019'>LRRK2-G2019S</abbr> mutations tend to have relatively good outcomes with DBS compared to other genetic types. 
            </p>
            
            <p>
                DBS of the globus pallidus internus (GPi) primarily targets the GABAergic output neurons of the basal ganglia, influencing motor output and reducing motor symptoms in PD. However, the therapeutic effects of GPi stimulation in PD extend beyond modulating GABAergic transmission within the basal ganglia circuitry and can indirectly impact cortical glutamatergic <em>input</em> to the basal ganglia.
            </p>
            <p>
                While GPi stimulation primarily targets the GABAergic output of the basal ganglia, the dopaminergic system remains a core problem in PD pathology and treatment. Dopamine depletion in the basal ganglia is a hallmark feature of PD and leads to motor symptoms such as bradykinesia, tremors, and rigidity, and DBS helps treat these problems.
            </p>
            <p>
                Other neurotransmitter systems affected by DBS include the serotonergic, cholinergic, noradrenergic, and glutamatergic systems. Due to the delicate balance between all these systems stimulation of the entire GPi can more easily achieve a positive, balanced effect, compared to medication and supplementation with l-dopa/carbidopa and supplements like 5-HTP and GABA.
            </p>
            <p>
                This normalizes basal ganglion activity resulting in reduced excitotoxicity, better neuronal function, and greater cell longevity.
            </p>
            <p>
                Medication alone leads to PN. DBS reduces the need for medication, thus mitigating PN. Supplementation further reduces the need for medication, and thus PN. A team of specialists to craft a program with DBS, medication,
                and supplementation may offer the best possible outcome with the least PN and greater longevity.
            </p>
            <p>
                Crafting a personalized treatment program that incorporates DBS, medication, and supplementation requires the expertise of a multidisciplinary team of specialists, including neurologists, movement disorder specialists,
                neurosurgeons, pharmacists, dietitians, and other healthcare professionals. This team can collaborate to tailor treatment to the individual patient's needs, optimize therapy, and minimize PN.

            <p>
                Induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) are generated by reprogramming adult somatic cells, such as skin or blood cells, to express the same genes as embryonic stem cells in a process called <dfn>induced pluripotency</dfn>. iPSCs can differentiate into any cell type in the body, similar to embryonic stem cells, but they are generated from adult cells, which makes them a promising source for regenerative medicine and tissue engineering. 
            </p>
            <p>
                When injected into the striatum and substantia nigra, iPSCs may promote the regeneration of lost dopaminergic neurons. However, this practice is not well-established and carries potential risks, including tumor formation. <cite class="reflink"><a href="#shastry">Shastry</a>, <a href="#bin-song">Bin Song</a></cite>

            <h3>Exercise</h3>
            <p>
                Maintaining a high degree of athleticism will have a positive impact on neurodegeneration by increasing blood flow to the brain, promoting neuroplasticity, and improving mood, sleep, and cognitive function. 
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Becoming an athlete requires maintaining a strong mindset to apply consistency with nutrition, lifestyle, exercise, supplementation. Focus on relative progress over current state. You can get better.
            </p>
            
            <h4>Physiological Response in the Brain</h4>
            <p>
             <abbr title="High intensity interval training">HIIT</abbr>, more than any other type of exercise, has been shown to fight neurodegeneration. It simultaneously stimulates multiple pathways and increases cerebral blood flow. Moderate and lower intensity cardiovascular exercise. "Zone 3" and "Zone 2" respectively, and active recovery provide supplementary benefits. <cite class="reflink"><a href="#lenhart">Lenhart</a>, <a href="#s-e-lucas">S.E. Lucas</a></cite>
            </p>
            
            <p>
                <abbr title="High-Intensity Interval Training">HIIT</abbr>, high-intensity cardiovascular training, resistance training, and endurance training are respectively the most effective at increasing neurotrophins such as <abbr title="Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor">BDNF</abbr>, <abbr title="Nerve Growth Factor">NGF</abbr>, <abbr title="Glial Line-Derived Neurotrophic Factor">GDNF</abbr>, <abbr title="Fibroblast Growth Factor 2">FGF2</abbr>, and <abbr title="Neurotrophin-3">NT-3</abbr>. These neurotrophins help protect neurons and glial cells.
            </p>
            <p>
              Such higher-intensity exercise increases the production of neuropeptides (<abbr title="Neuropeptide Y">NPY</abbr>, <dfn title="Substance P — neuropeptide involved in various physiological processes.">Substance P</dfn>, Enkephalins) and signaling hormones (<abbr title="Insulin-like Growth Factor 1">IGF-I</abbr>, <abbr title="vascular endothelial growth factor">VEGF</abbr>, Cortisol). 
            </p>

            <h5>IGF-I Benefits</h5>
            
            <p>
                IGF-I supports dopaminergic neuron survival by activating its receptors and inhibiting apoptosis. It also improves insulin sensitivity and glucose uptake, a problem that often accompanies disease progression.
            </p>
            
            <p>             
                By upregulating creatine transporters, IGF-I optimizes cellular energy metabolism, supporting neuronal health and cognitive function. Its anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties reduce oxidative stress and inflammation, preserving cerebrovascular integrity and protecting the blood-brain barrier and choroid plexus.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                These combined effects promote autophagy, which removes dysfunctional proteins and organelles, improve mitochondrial function through ATP synthesis, and reduce neural apoptosis. This can improve ischemic conditions and sleep.
            </p>
            
            <h4>Lower-intensity Exercise (Zone 2)</h4>   
            <p>         
                Lower-intensity exercise, such as "Zone 2", is moderately low-intensity aerobic exercise, such as fast walking or hiking, that occurs just below the lactate threshold and can be sustained for a long period without strain or heavy breathing. Although low-intensity exercise may not boost neurotrophic factors as acutely as high-intensity workouts, it supports overall brain health and helps maintain a baseline level of these factors for improved endurance, enhanced recovery, increased mitochondrial production, and reduced overtraining, making it an excellent addition to any fitness routine.
            </p>
            
            <h4>Proprioceptive Activities</h4>
            <p>
                Complex motor activities that require significant proprioception, such as dancing, have been shown to be beneficial and may increase blood flow to the midbrain. Further research is needed to clarify their precise effects on <abbr title="Glial Line-Derived Neurotrophic Factor">GDNF</abbr>. <cite class="reflink"><a href="#baudet">Baudet</a>, <a href="#aman">Aman</a></cite>
            </p>
           
            <h4>Peak Performance</h4>
            <p>
                Increasing exercise intensity, VO<sub>2</sub> max, duration, and frequency leads to greater benefits. Contrary to the "minimum effective dose" approach in medicine, with exercise, more is better. Improving the limits of exercise tolerance through supplementation and recovery strategies can improve physiological performance and decrease recovery times, allowing for more exercise to be performed, conferring more neurological and physical benefits. 
            </p>
            
            <h4>Limits to Exercise</h4>
            <p>
                Intense exercise, while beneficial, is physically and mentally taxing, increasing Reactive Oxygen and Nitrogen Species (RONS) and creating metabolic waste. To maximize the benefits of exercise, incorporate active recovery strategies such as mobility work, supplementation, and red light therapy to enhance exercise tolerance.
            </p>
            
            <h4>Supplementation and Recovery</h4>
            <p>
                Timing supplementation around exercise is beneficial as it enhances nutrient delivery to the brain due to increased cerebral blood flow. Pre- and intra-workout supplementation can boost performance, while post-workout supplementation aids in recovery and improves subsequent performance. Protein intake immediately after exercise can increase satiety and reduce energy intake, which helps regulate blood glucose levels. <cite class="reflink"><a href="#querido">Querido</a>, <a href="#clayton">D. Clayton</a>, <a href="#monteyne">A. Monteyne</a></cite>
            </p>
            
            <p>
                For example, <a href="#creatine">creatine monohydrate supplementation</a> increases brain creatine levels. During stress or trauma, such as intense exercise, creatine helps reduce oxidative DNA damage and restores normal brain and body creatine levels.
            </p>
            <h4>Types of Exercise</h4>
            <p>
                The categories of exercise that elicit a physiological effect on the brain include:
            </p>
            <dl>
                <dt>HIIT  — High-Intensity Interval Training
                <dd> short periods of high-intensity effort, followed by brief periods of rest or low-intensity activity. This alternating pattern is repeated until exhaustion to maintain heart rate throughout the workout.
                </dd>
                
                <dt> HIT — High-Intensity Training
                </dt>
                
                <dd> strength training with high intensity and brief workouts. This improves cognitive function and brain health by increasing cerebral blood flow, <abbr title="Brain-derived Neurotrophic Factor">BDNF</abbr>, IGF-1, and osteocalcin. <cite class="reflink"><a href="#browne">Browne</a></cite>
                </dd>
                
                <dt>Zone 4 cardio</dt>
                <dd>High-intensity exercise zone,  80-90% of maximum heart rate (HRmax), Typically 2-10 minutes with a maximum sustained duration of around 15 minutes. Also known as "lactate threshold" or redline training.
                </dd>
                
                <dt> Zone 3 — Moderate-intensity cardiovascular training (70-80% of HRmax) 
                </dt>
                <dd> Enhances cerebral blood flow, metabolic, and cardiovascular health with a reduced risk of injury.
                </dd>               
                <dt> Zone 2 — Low-intensity cardiovascular training
                </dt>
                <dd>  Boosts aerobic endurance and promotes recovery with minimal injury risk.
                </dd>               
            </dl>

            <h4>Active Recovery</h4>
            <p>
                Active recovery elevates heart rate, enhancing blood flow to deliver nutrients, remove waste from tissues, and hasten recovery. It can address mobility issues such as tight hips and a weak core or glutes, reducing injury risk.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Exercise increases brain blood flow, delivering oxygen and nutrients to brain cells. This triggers processes like neurogenesis, increased neurotransmitter production, and improved stress tolerance. Additionally, it boosts <abbr title="Brain-derived Neurotrophic Factor">BDNF</abbr>, promotes autophagy, reduces proinflammatory cytokines, and lowers blood sugar. These effects enhance memory, cognition, and mood, helping to counter neurodegeneration.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                This results in better memory and cognition and improved mood, countering or staving off neurodegeneration.
            </p>
            
            <h4>Mitochondrial Benefits</h4>
            <p>
                Regular exercise enhances NAD+ biosynthesis, activates AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and sirtuins, and stimulates mitochondrial biogenesis. It also promotes mitochondrial turnover and mitophagy, supporting healthy mitochondrial function.
            </p>
            
            <h4>Sample Exercise Plan</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Day 1: HIT + Zone 2 Cardio
                </li><li>Day 2: Zone 3 Cardio (40 min ergometer)
                </li><li>Day 3: HIIT + Active Recovery
                </li><li>Day 4: Zone 3 Cardio
                </li><li>Day 5: HIT + Zone 2 Cardio
                </li><li>Day 6: Zone 3 Cardio
                </li><li>Day 7: HIIT + Active Recovery
                </li>
            </ul>
            
            <h4>Summary</h4>
            <p>
                Intense exercise counteracts neurodegeneration and enhances neurological health by increasing cerebral blood flow, promoting neurogenesis, boosting neurotransmitter production, and reducing inflammation. Different exercise types, including <abbr title="High intensity interval training">HIIT</abbr>, <abbr title="High intensity training">HIT</abbr>, Zone 3, and Zone 2, offer distinct benefits. Balancing intense exercise with active recovery helps reduce injury and hasten recovery to improve exercise tolerance and maximize the results.

            <p>
                Photobiomodulation (PBM) is a non-invasive, low-risk treatment that improves cellular function using specific wavelengths of light. It can be done in clinics using high intensity lasers and at home using consumer devices, offering flexibility for patients seeking ongoing treatment.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Despite the large body of experimental and early clinical evidence, there is still much resistance to the use of photobiomodulation by patients and health professionals.

            <h4>PBM and Neurological Health</h4>
            <h5>Oxidative Stress and Brain Inflammation</h5>
            <p>
                PBM inhibits oxidative stress-related damage in the hippocampus and elevates <abbr title="Brain-derived Neurotrophic Factor">BDNF</abbr> levels, effectively treating nerve damage and neuroinflammation. <cite class="reflink"><a href="#j-c-heo">J.C. Heo</a></cite>
            </p>

            <h5>Ischemia and Blood Flow</h5>

            <p>
                Ischemia can affect the delivery of therapeutic agents to the desired target in the midbrain. During ischemic events, blood flow to affected brain regions can be significantly compromised, limiting the delivery of oxygen, nutrients, and therapeutic compounds like mesenchymal cells (as mentioned elsewhere), melatonin, or any substance entering the brain.

            <h4>Effects on Parkinson’s Disease</h4>
            <h5>Red Light's Impact on Motor Cortex and Stem Cells</h5>
            <p>
                Red light reaches the motor cortex, influences stem cell function, offers neuroprotection, restores functional activity, improves motor behaviors and reduces clinical signs, reduces <dfn title="Gliosos — when glial cells, CNS cells that support nerve cells, proliferate or hypertrophy in response to damage">gliosis</dfn>, and induces expression of trophic growth factors.

            </p>
            
            <h5>Impact on Kidney Function</h5>
            <p>
                Parkinson’s disease impairs renal function due to α-synuclein aggregation, inflammation, autonomic nervous system (ANS) dysfunction, and dopamine depletion (dopamine influences renal blood flow, blood pressure, and kidney function). Although the effects are less pronounced until the later stages of the disease, the damage begins earlier. <cite class="reflink"><a href="#bozic">Bozic</a></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
                Red light improves renal function by improving renal blood flow for healing and waste clearance.  <cite class="reflink"><a href="#j-bian">Bian</a></cite>
            </p>
            
            <h4>Near-Infrared (NIR) vs Red Light Therapy</h4>
            <p>
                Although numerous positive results have been observed in humans, depth penetration of the light waves is a concern. NIR light penetrates deeper than NIR, and coherent NIR (<abbr title="Light Amplification by Stimulated Emission of Radiation">laser</abbr>) even deeper. Cellular effects observed in rodents with NIR light can't be extrapolated to the much larger head thickness (and midbrain depth) of humans. <cite class="reflink"><a href="#y-lampl">Y. Lampl</a></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
                Near-infrared (NIR) light has a deeper penetration depth than red light, allowing it to reach deeper tissues and organs, including the brain, without overstimulating the skin. <cite class="reflink"><a href="#t-a-henderson">T.A. Henderson</a></cite>
            </p>

            <p>
                Red light can also be effective but the longer duration and stronger intensity required for efficacy may overstimulate the skin. Consumer LED devices that allow blending NIR and red frequencies should use lower intensity for the red frequencies to avoid burning or overstimulating the skin. This strategy can take advantage of their dermal benefits without damaging the skin while getting more intense NIR for the deep regions of the brain.
            </p>
            
            <h4>Practical Applications of PBM</h4>
            <h5>Timing and Frequency</h5>
            <p>
                The timing of PBM, in conjunction with the administration of substances like melatonin, may help improve delivery by mitigating the effects of ischemic inhibition on nutrient delivery to the midbrain. Whole body irradiation with red light improves sleep quality. Using it before sleep may offer better sleep effects. <cite class="reflink"><a href="#jiexiu-zhao">Jiexiu Zhao</a></cite>
            </p>

            <h4>Frequency</h4>
            <p>
                Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s disease models require daily treatments to show benefits. In-home devices offer convenience, comfort, and affordability. <cite class="reflink"><a href="#michael-r-hamblin">Hamblin</a></cite>

                        These data demonstrate that PBMT inhibits hippocampal damage induced by oxidative stress and increases the expression of BDNF in the hippocampus, a part of the brain used for learning and memory, located deep in the temporal lobe.

                        To examine the cellular process in the hippocampus, mice were used. Although the data are impressive, the problem with extrapolating data to humans is the size of the human head is much larger, thereby damping the intensity of the NIR waves as they aim toward the deep brain regions. A possible workaround is to direct the light towards the back, to target the CSF.

            How to Build a Care Team
        </h2>
        <section id="care-team-introduction">
            <h3>Introduction</h3>

            <p>
                Optimizing health is complex, and a PD diagnosis increases that. Conventional medicine fails to adequately address peripheral and autonomic nervous system (ANS) dysfunction, which typically manifests as GI issues, loss of bladder and bowel control, sleep problems, and ultimately, heart failure and death. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Seeking 'alternative' approaches without critical analysis is equally flawed. The only true alternative to effective treatment is ineffective treatment, and that raises the problem of determining efficacy.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Many medical professionals, whether conventional or alternative, fall short. Trusting them may lead you to take medications that do not improve health and may hasten disease progression. In PD, this may include beta-3 agonists, anticholinergics, or fludrocortisones. Worse, they may also offer "mind-body-spirit" treatments lacking scientific support or clear mechanisms of action.
            </p>
                        
            <p>
                It is the patient's responsibility to audit his medical team. Begin by consulting independent specialists and exploring reputable integrative medicine practices. Seek out patient communities for recommendations on doctors who prioritize a comprehensive approach.
            </p>

            <p>
                The onus of responsibility to learn, assess claims, and take actions for your health is on you. This involves understanding the science behind treatments and engaging in self-advocacy to actively participate in the decision-making process. Skepticism isn’t just healthy; it’s essential for survival and well-being.

            <h3>How to Interview Neurologists</h3>
            <p>
               Doctors may be limited by institutional protocols.
             </p>
             <p>
                Assessing provider competence requires a more thorough approach than just checking credentials, affiliations, and years of experience.
            </p>
            <p>
                Approach the interview from a position of informed knowledge without revealing too much. When given the opportunity to speak freely, how do they err?
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The effectiveness of that strategy depends on one's knowledge and comprehension — specifically the depth and breadth of understanding and the ability to evaluate and scrutinize the accuracy of the interlocutor's information.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Better results are achieved by preparing detailed questions that delve into the neurologist's expertise in the specific area of concern.

                <p>
                    Not mentioning genetic testing without providing context or justification.

                <p>
                    The doctor says that genetic testing does not lead to more effective therapies or disease modification. Evidence to the contrary is provided throughout this document (See also: <a href="#genetic-factors">genetic factors</a>).

                <p>
                    How the doctor explains non-motor symptom management, such as sleep or mood disorders. Ideally, they should be able to discuss conventional and less common treatments in simple terms.
                </p>

                    <li>
                         If the doctor can't explain the mechanisms of action (e.g., of turmeric, photobiomodulation) in simple terms, he likely doesn't understand them well himself.

                <p>
                    A good response should include a recent example of implementing new research-based treatment, with evidence, rationale, and measured results.

                <p>
            These questions and expected answers help ensure doctors follow a comprehensive, current approach to PD but also demonstrate critical thinking and a nuanced understanding of the disease. Doctors are not immune to common mental errors.

                <h3>Tips for Selecting Providers</h3>
                <p>
                    Referrals typically come from a PCP or neurologist, but some patients also seek input from functional medicine specialists. The goal is to assemble a comprehensive care team, regardless of the initial referral source.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Institutional protocols often influence treatment approach. It's important to have a neurologist who is willing to consider evidence-based treatments beyond the conventional standard of care.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Patient-centered care addressing root causes and individualized needs predicts the best results. Starting with a Functional and Integrative Medicine Specialist can be great. However, to avoid unqualified practitioners, it's essential to be well-informed.
                </p>
                <p>
                    During your initial consultation with a neurologist, discuss the <a href="#impact-dopamine-agonists">side-effects of <abbr title="Dopamine Replacement Therapy">DRT</abbr></a>.  Ask about specific treatments such as <a href="#hrt" title="hormone replacement therapy">HRT</a>, <a title="Photobiomodulation" href="#pbm">PBM</a>, and <a href="#5-htp">5-HTP</a>, and how they might interact with <abbr title="Dopamine Replacement Therapy">DRT</abbr>. If the doctor cannot explain their benefits or potential interactions, it may be worth seeking another opinion.
                </p>
        
                <blockquote>
                    <p>
                        &ldquo;It is better to know some of the questions than all of the answers.&rdquo;

                <p>
                    Creating a health optimization plan is difficult, especially for PD, which requires specialized expertise. Those who approach this with seriousness and understanding can expect to achieve a better quality of life and longevity.

            Supplements
        </h3>
        <p>
            Supplements complement food and help manage PD by addressing specific <a href="#problems-list">mechanisms</a> involved in its progression. They also enhance exercise performance, aid in recovery, support better sleep, and improve overall health and well-being. An overview of each supplement is provided following the legend below.
        </p>

		<h3>Warning on Supplements</h3>
		<p>
			Dietary supplements have limited safety and purity regulation.
		</p>
		<p>
			Supplement manufacturers commonly and legally use titanium dioxide (TiO₂) as a coating in supplements. The problem is that it can harm cellular function and brain health. A 2021 BioNanoScience review and supporting studies have shown review published in BioNanoScience, have shown TiO₂ nanoparticles induce oxidative stress, cause cellular inflammation, disrupt mitochondrial function, and cause genetic damage. In the brain, TiO₂ can damage neurons via oxidative stress, impair spatial memory, disturb neurotransmitter balance, and has potential to accumulate in brain tissues. While many excipients are harmless in the amounts used in supplements, some—especially TiO₂—are not. Additionally, many artificial food colorings, such as Red #40, Yellow #5, and Blue #1, have been linked to potential health concerns. The US FDA does not require safety testing for supplement coatings, including TiO₂, which puts the onus on the consumer to stick to reputable brands and formulations and <strong>read the ingredients label</strong>. <cite class="reflink"><a href="#shabbir">shabbir</a>, <a href="#herrera-rodriguez">Herrera-Rodríguez</a></cite>
		</p>
		
        <h4>Nutrition</h4>
        <h5>Nutritional Impact on Parkinson’s Disease</h5>
        <p>
            Some nutritional deficiencies can exacerbate PD symptoms and may be misinterpreted as progressive neurodegeneration, leading to inappropriate management if not addressed.
        </p>
        <p>
            Others can trigger cascading effects and hasten neurodegeneration. For example, deficiencies in vitamins B6, B12, folate, and D3 impair mitochondrial function, increase oxidative stress, and affect neurotransmitter synthesis, impacting neurological and overall health. These deficiencies can be caused by diet, lack of sun exposure, metabolic loss, or medications.
        </p>
<!--
        <h5>Dietary Considerations</h5>
        <p>
            Eggs are a source of omega-3 fatty acids, choline, lutein, zeaxanthin, vitamin E, beta carotene, vitamin A, and selenium. Pasture-raised eggs contain more bioactive compounds and less saturated fat and cholesterol. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Many plants contain phytochemicals that can improve conditions and inhibit the progression of PD. (See also:
<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6433754/"
>Plant Extracts and Phytochemicals Targeting &alpha;-Synuclein Aggregation in Parkinson's Disease Models</a>.)
        </p>
        -->
        <h4>Comprehensive Treatment Plans</h4>
        <p>
            A comprehensive, individualized treatment plan around nutrition and supplements involve everyone on the patient's team, encompassing exercise specialists and doctors. Regular testing and monitoring of symptoms and biochemical markers should be conducted to assess the effectiveness of interventions and make adjustments as needed. The patient must take an active role and own the treatment plan, rather than relying solely on his doctor.
        </p>  
        
        <h4>Antifibrillogenic Compounds</h4>
        <p>
            <dfn>Antifibrillogenic</dfn> compounds mitigate <dfn>fibrillogenesis</dfn>, the formation of α-synuclein fibrils from aggregates, a fundamental pathology in PD.
            
        </p>
        
        <h5>Delayed Causality</h5>
        <p>
            Although evidence for these compounds is limited and their effects not be immediately noticeable, this does not mean they are ineffective. Just as the development of PD often goes unnoticed for years before diagnosis, reventing fibrillogenesis won't produce immediate, noticeable effects. Both the disease and its counteraction aren't noticeable through daily symptom monitoring. Fibrillization is harmful, and stopping it is beneficial, even if not immediately apparent.
        </p>
        
        <h4>Preventing Fibril Aggregation</h4>
        <p>
            Preventing fibril aggregation: These treatments focus on inhibiting the aggregation of α-synuclein fibrils into Lewy bodies, potentially slowing the spread of pathology and neurodegeneration.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            The effects of antifibrillogenic interventions cannot be measured in laboratory settings. Regular neurological evaluations and symptom monitoring can offer some indirect evidence of changes in disease progression or symptom management but cannot establish any effect on fibrillization. Until laboratory assessments become available, combining clinical assessments with research insights remains the best approach for evaluating the potential impact of antifibrillogenic interventions.
        </p>
        
        <h4>Choosing Effective Treatments and Practitioners</h4>
        <p>
            Doctors who prioritize effective treatments should be favored, and those who dismiss claims without examination avoided. Focus should be placed on facts and evidence, risk versus reward, and health optimization. 
        </p>

            <p>
                GlyNAC (Glycine-N-Acetyl Cysteine) is a combination of two separate amino acids, glycine, and N-acetylcysteine (NAC), both non-essential amino acids, administered together in a 1:1 ratio to promote the body's synthesis of glutathione, the master antioxidant. In addition to enhancing glutathione synthesis, GlyNAC offers several other physiological benefits.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Beyond improving glutathione production, GlyNAC supplementation improves mitochondrial function, reduces inflammation, supports neurotrophic factor expression, and improves cognitive function. <cite class="reflink"><a href="#g-lizzo">g-lizzo</a>, <a href="#p-kumar">Premranjan Kumar</a>, <a href="#p-kumar_o-osahon">P. Kumar 2</a>, <a href="#p-kumar_r-sekhar">Premranjan Kumar (2)</a></cite>
            </p>

			<h4>Cognitive Effects</h4>
			<p>
			A 2021 clinical trial showed GlyNAC improves glutathione levels, mitochondrial function, and insulin sensitivity while reducing oxidative stress and inflammation.f NMDARs showed pro-cognitive and antidepressant effects. <cite class="reflink"><a href="#p-kumar">Premranjan Kumar</a></cite>
			</p>
			
			<h4>Glycine, Collagen, and NAC</h4>
			<p>
				While the effects of the 1:1 ratio of glycine to NAC is proven, glycine and NAC can be taken independently for a fraction of the cost, with the same benefits. 
			</p>
			
			<p>
				Collagen is about 20% glycine, making its supplementation a substantial contributor to glycine intake, shattering the patented "GlyNAC" 1:1 ratio formula. Nighttime collagen supplementation was shown to improve sleep in physically active males with sleep complaints, possibly due to its glycine content <cite class="reflink"><a href="#thomas">Thomas</a></cite>. Collagen's high glycine content, however, does not necessarily obviate its benefits on bone and connective tissue, including <abbr title="cerebrospinal fluid">CSF</abbr> production and barrier support in the brain, choroid plexus, basement membrane, dura mater, and structural support in neurons. 
			</p>
			
			<h4>Sleep-Promoting Effects</h4>
			<p>
				Glycine supplementation has been shown in multiple studies to improve sleep quality both subjectively and objectively. The mechanism seems to be via peripheral vasodilatation through the activation of NMDA receptors in the hypothalamus, which has the effect of increasing peripheral blood flow and lowering core temperature. These effects can also explain how it improves ischemic conditions. <cite class="reflink"><a href="#kawai">Kawai</a>, <a href="#villanueva">Quintanilla-Villanueva</a></cite>
			</p>
            
            <h4>Supplementation</h4>
            <p>
                 GlyNAC supplementation up to 7.2g per day is safe and well tolerated in older adults. GlyNAC is best taken at night. A cost-effective alternative approach would be to take 10g collagen peptides, 1g glycine powder, and 3g NAC.
            </p>
            <p>
                The half-life of NAC in the body is about 6 hours, and the half-life of glycine is anywhere from 25-250 minutes, so taking it at night allows for optimal utilization of the amino acids. <cite class="reflink"><a href="#p-kumar_o-osahon">P. Kumar 2</a></cite>
            </p>
            
            <h4>Side Effects</h4>
            <p>
                N-acetyl cysteine (NAC) can cause next-day lethargy. If experiencing this, the dose should be reduced, taken earlier in the evening, and bedtime adjusted accordingly.

                Collagen makes up 30% of the body's protein and supports the extracellular matrix (ECM), the physical scaffolding that surrounds and supports cells throughout various tissues in the body. In the brain, the <abbr title="extracellular matrix">ECM</abbr> also maintains neuronal structure and synapse function. This can be compromised in PD.
            </p>
            <p>
                Collagen peptide (CP) supplementation increases glycosaminoglycan (GAG) production, which maintains tissue flexibility and moisture. It also influences gene expression related to collagen and elastin, promoting <abbr title="extracellular matrix">ECM</abbr> stability and tissue repair. When combined with exercise, CP may improve joint health and mobility, addressing some of the physical challenges faced by PD patients.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                CP is comprised of amino acids, with glycine making up roughly 20-22% of their total weight. Glycine is one of the three amino acids necessary for glutathione (GSH) synthesis, an important antioxidant in the body.

            <h4>Sleep Benefits</h4>
            <p>
                A 2024 <abbr title="randomized controlled trial">RCT</abbr> showed collagen peptides reduced sleep interruptions and improved cognitive function in athletic males. <cite class="reflink"><a href="#thomas">Thomas</a></cite>

            <h4>Relevance to PD</h4>
            
            <p>
                CP supplementation was correlated with increased gray matter, improved memory, standard verbal paired associate learning (S-PA) tests, and changes in the physical, mental, and role/social component summary scores, reflecting improved brain health. <cite class="reflink"><a href="#koizumi">Koizumi</a></cite>

            <p>
                 In PD, tissue repair and resilience are weakened. Collagen peptides supplementation strengthens the <abbr title="extracellular matrix ">ECM</abbr> and related structures such as the BBB and choroid plexus. This could help protect against neurodegenerative damage.
            </p>
            <p>
                Research shows that <abbr title="extracellular matrix ">ECM</abbr> pathways are dysregulated in dopaminergic neurons from PD patients, impacting synaptic activity and neuronal function <cite class="reflink"><a href="#rosh">Rosh</a></cite>. Collagen peptides can improve <abbr title="extracellular matrix ">ECM</abbr> health and might help mitigate some of the neurodegenerative effects seen in PD.

                Research indicates that glycine supplementation can increase glycine levels in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), potentially offering neuroprotective effects. <cite class="reflink"><a href="#bannai">Bannai</a></cite>

                A 2019 study gave collagen hydrolysates (CH) to 30 healthy people, aged 49 to 63 years, once a day for 4 weeks. This resulted in a positive effect on gray matter volume, brain structure, and cognitive language ability. <cite class="reflink"><a href="#koizumi">Koizumi</a></cite>

            <h5>Collagen Peptides, The Choroid Plexus, and CSF Production</h5>

            <p>
                <abbr title="Collagen Peptides">CP</abbr> strengthens the choroid plexus and BBB and supports CSF production. <abbr title="cerebrospinal fluid">CSF</abbr>. 
            </p>
            <p>
                The choroid plexus produces most of the CSF and serves as a barrier between the blood and CSF, regulating the exchange of substances between the two. 50-60% of the choroid plexus is loose connective tissue, which supports the production and regulation of CSF. <abbr title="Collagen Peptides">CP</abbr> improves connective tissue health, so probably improves the choroid plexus.
            </p>
            <p>
                When the choroid plexus is weakened, the damage to the barrier it creates leads to neuroinflammation and impaired clearance of toxic metabolites. In PD, mutant α-synuclein spreads into the CSF, and this is proportionally facilitated by choroid plexus dysfunction. Mutant α-synuclein may also accumulate in the epithelial cells of the choroid plexus and be transported into the CSF, potentially disrupting its clearance between the brain and CSF. <abbr title="Collagen Peptides">CP</abbr> supplementation improves neurological health and strengthens the <abbr title="extracellular matrix ">ECM</abbr>, and strengthening the choroid process is likely part of the mechanism of action. This could aid in mitigating neuroinflammation and facilitating protein clearance in conditions like PD. <cite class="reflink"><a href="#rosh">Rosh</a>, <a href="#koizumi">Koizumi</a></cite>
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Collagen, especially types IV and XVII, is a major  structural protein in the BBB that supports the basal lamina, a layer anchoring and separating epithelial cells from the underlying connective tissues such as blood vessels and nerves. Supplementing collagen types I and IV can increase type XVII (COL17) production, and IGF-I may further enhance this. 
            </p>
            
            <h5>Hyaluronic Acid — Collagen Peptides' BBB Synergist</h5>
            <p>
                Hyaluronic acid (HA) retains moisture in the <abbr title="extracellular matrix ">ECM</abbr> and helps maintain tight junctions between endothelial cells. These tight junctions are essential for the BBB’s selective barrier, preventing harmful substances from entering the brain. Together, collagen peptides and HA support the BBB’s strength and flexibility.
            </p>
            
            <h4>Supplementation</h4>
            <p>
                Taking 7-10 grams of collagen peptides at night may promote relaxation, lower core temperature, reduce awakenings, and improve cognitive function. <cite class="reflink"><a href="#bannai">Bannai</a>, <a href="#thomas">Thomas</a></cite> 
            </p>
            
            <h4>Collagen with NAC</h4>
            <p>
                Taking collagen peptides with N-acetylcysteine (NAC) helps increase glutathione (GSH) levels, reduces inflammation, and supports mitochondrial function. This combination can be an effective alternative to <abbr title="Glycine N-acetylcysteine">GlyNAC</abbr>. 1.5g of <abbr title="N-acetylcysteine">NAC</abbr> combined with 7.5g of <abbr title="Collagen Peptides">CP</abbr> should provide benefits similar to 3g of GlyNAC. CP is approximately 20-22% glycine, so 7.5g of <abbr title="Collagen Peptides">CP</abbr> contains roughly 1.5g of glycine.
            </p>
            
            <h4>Measuring Efficacy</h4>
            <p>
                Measure <abbr title="glycosaminoglycan">GAG</abbr> levels before and after the intervention to directly assess changes in ECM health. Non-invasive techniques, such as ultrasound, can evaluate soft tissue or joint health. Additionally, motor tests assessing joint flexibility and movement may provide useful insights.
            </p>
            <p>
                Procollagen Type I and III tests assess new collagen production, indicating connective tissue and ECM health. This provides a useful indicator of <abbr title="extracellular matrix ">ECM</abbr> health.

            <h4>Creatine and Energy Production</h4>
            <p>
                Creatine is a naturally occurring amino acid that the body produces and obtains from diet. It stores and supplies energy to muscle, brain, and cardiac cells. Creatine helps regenerate ATP, the primary energy source for cells, in what is called the <dfn>phosphagen</dfn> or ATP-PC (Adenosine Triphosphate-Phosphocreatine) system, for rapid energy production during high demand.
            </p>

            <p>
                 Creatine reduces oxidative stress by lowering mitochondrial workload and scavenging free radicals, thereby minimizing mitochondrial damage, protecting cells, and reducing their death. <cite class="reflink"><a href="#c-rae">C. Rae</a>, <a href="#a-c-passaquin">A.C. Passaquin</a>, <a href="#h-arazi">H. Arazi</a></cite>
            </p>
            
            <h4>Creatine and Exercise</h4>
            <p>
                Creatine improves muscular strength and exercise recovery, supporting health optimization when combined with physical activity. <cite class="reflink"><a href="#h-chang">H. Chang</a></cite>
            </p>
            
            <h4>Cellular Mechanism of Action</h4>
            <p>
                Understanding the <abbr title="Adenosine Triphosphate-Phosphocreatine">ATP-PC</abbr> system—how its energy production helps cognitive and neural health—can inform supplementation. However, this knowledge isn't required to benefit from creatine use.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Mitochondria generate energy primarily through the citric acid cycle and oxidative phosphorylation (<abbr title="oxidative phosphorylation">OXPHOS</abbr>). The citric acid cycle converts acetyl-CoA into energy intermediates like <abbr title="Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide Hydrogen (reduced)">NADH</abbr>, which fuel <abbr title="oxidative phosphorylation">OXPHOS</abbr> to produce <abbr title="adenosine triphosphate">ATP</abbr>, the main energy source for cells. During this process, CO<sub>2</sub> is released, and <abbr title="Reactive Oxygen and Nitrogen Species">RONS</abbr> are produced. In the cell, creatine (<abbr title="creatine monohydrate">CM</abbr>) is converted by creatine kinase (CK) to creatine phosphate (CP), which quickly replenishes <abbr title="adenosine triphosphate">ATP</abbr> during high-energy demands, alleviating stress on <abbr title="oxidative phosphorylation">OXPHOS</abbr> and reducing <abbr title="Reactive Oxygen and Nitrogen Species">RONS</abbr> production. This supports cellular function and mitochondrial health.
            </p>

            <h5>Creatine as Cellular Energy for Synapses</h5> 
            <p>
                The brain is highly glucose-dependent, accounting for roughly 20% of the body’s total energy expenditure despite its small size. Neuronal synapses require a lot of energy to release neurotransmitters, which need <abbr title="adenosine triphosphate">ATP</abbr>. Inside neurons, creatine is bound to phosphate as <abbr title="Creatine Phosphate">CP</abbr>, just as it does in skeletal muscle cells. Creatine donates a phosphate to <abbr title="adenosine diphosphate">ADP</abbr> to form <abbr title="adenosine triphosphate">ATP</abbr>, which then supplies the energy needed for synaptic function.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Creatine supplementation increases brain creatine levels. During stress or trauma, such as intense exercise, creatine supplementation improves oxidative DNA injury and normalizes brain and body creatine levels. <cite class="reflink"><a href="#s-forbes">S. Forbes</a></cite>
            </p>

            <p>
                A 2023 review study published in Sports Medicine found long-term high-dosage creatine supplementation increases brain creatine stores, improves cognition and memory, especially in older adults or during times of metabolic stress (e.g. sleep deprivation), improves aspects of recovery from traumatic brain injury in children, and has the potential to reduce symptoms of depression and anxiety. <cite class="reflink"><a href="#d-candow">D. Candow</a></cite>
            </p>
            
            <h4>Creatine and PD</h4>
            <p>
                Creatine has shown neuroprotection in PD patients with cognitive decline via creatine transporter uptake. In a rodent model, high-dosage creatine was shown to exert anti-inflammatory, antioxidative, and anti-aggregant effects on α-synucleinopathy. <cite class="reflink"><a href="#y-leem">Y. Leem</a>, <a href="#h-chang">H. Chang</a></cite>
            </p>
            
            <p>
                A long-term, multicenter, double-blind, parallel-group, placebo-controlled, 1:1 randomized efficacy trial for 10g of creatine in PD patients showed benefit to the <abbr title="Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale">UPDRS</abbr> both at 1 year and at 18 months but eventually terminated early with no determined harm or benefit. <cite class="reflink"><a href="#k-kieburtz">K. Kieburtz</a></cite>
            </p>
            
            <p>
                These results are not entirely disappointing. The study's lack of focus on pairing creatine with intensive exercise may have limited its ability to detect potential benefits.
            </p>
                
            <p>
                <abbr title="High Intensity Interval Training">HIIT</abbr> significantly mitigates and may partially reverse progressive neurodegeneration. However, high-intensity exercise also depletes brain creatine, which impacts neurological function. 
            </p>
            <p>             
                Had the patients in this study been assigned to a <abbr title="High Intensity Interval Training">HIIT</abbr> regimen, they would have benefitted from the exercise. HIIT depletes creatine levels and may deplete brain creatine levels. Creatine supplementation might result in less exercise-induced depletion of creatine, less oxidative damage caused by the exercise, and better exercise recovery (allowing for more frequent training). Such a design might have revealed a more significant benefit to the 10g ED creatine supplementation. However, despite the study's design, beneficial effects <em>were</em> observed at 1 year and at 18 months. <cite class="reflink"><a href="#b-laat">B. Laat</a></cite>
            </p>
            
            
            <h4>Supplementation</h4>
            
            <p>
                Taking creatine with food improves absorption. Eating stimulates insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) production, which helps increase creatine uptake. Because dosages recommended for neurological function tend to be much higher, in excess of 20g per day, those with impaired kidney function might consider a more moderate dose as a compromise. 
            </p>
             
            <h4>Safety and Efficacy</h4>
            <p>
                Creatine is commonly used with minimal adverse effects reported in clinical studies.
            </p>
            <p>
                Creatine supplementation alone may not significantly slow the progression of Parkinson's disease, especially not in the later stages. But its neuroprotective and antioxidant effects contribute to overall disease management when used as part of a comprehensive treatment approach, particularly in combination with exercise, to stave off disease progression in the early stages of the disease. Because creatine helps with exercise recovery, its use allows for more frequent training to enjoy the benefits of exercise.

            <p>
                Taurine is a naturally occurring non-essential amino acid found in meat, fish, and eggs, with benefits for cardiovascular and neurological health, mitochondrial function, antioxidant protection, bone and cartilage formation, and calcium regulation. Taurine acts as an antioxidant and osmolyte, helping to regulate intracellular osmotic pressure and maintaining cellular homeostasis, helping to protect against DNA damage and prevent cell death.
            </p>
            
            <h4>Taurine and Aging</h4>
            <p>
            	A 2023 study on taurine in various animals found that circulating taurine levels decreased with age. Supplementation with taurine slowed markers of aging, including DNA damage, telomerase deficiency, impaired mitochondrial function, and cellular senescence. Loss of taurine in humans was associated with aging-related diseases, and concentrations of taurine and its metabolites increased in response to exercise. Taurine supplementation improved lifespan in mice and healthspan in monkeys. 
            </p>
            <p>
            	For one of their experiments, the researchers gave 14-month-old mice—middle-aged mice—500 or 1000mg taurine per day for 10-12 months. This supplementation increased median lifespan by 10 to 12%. When they investigated the health of taurine-fed middle-aged mice, they found an improved functioning of bone, muscle, pancreas, brain, fat, gut, and immune system, indicating an overall increase in health span. <cite class="reflink"><a href="#singh">Singh</a></cite>
            </p>
            
            <h4>Calcium-Regulating Effects</h4>
            <p>
                Taurine helps the body use and regulate calcium, both intracellularly, by preventing its excessive entry into neurons and systemically, by helping shuttle extracellular calcium into bones. 
            </p>
            <p> 
                Taurine's functioning as an osmolyte helps to prevent calcium overload, counteracting the adverse effects of glutamate toxicity, reducing endoplasmic reticulum stress, and sparing mitochondrial function. Under excitotoxic conditions (e.g., excess glutamate), intracellular calcium can increase due to NMDA receptor hyperactivity. Taurine’s osmoregulatory effect helps buffer against these sudden ionic shifts and subsequent calcium influx that would otherwise contribute to ER stress and mitochondrial overload.
<cite class="reflink"><a href="#baliou">Baliou</a>, <a href="#schaffer">Schaffer</a></cite>
            </p>
            
            <p> 
	             Taurine influences calcium, including voltage-gated calcium channels and the NMDA receptor channel, by stabilizing membrane potential, or difference in the concentration of electrolytes between the intracellular and extracellular environments, and reducing excitability. This moderates excessive calcium entry into the cell without directly acting as a strong agonist of GABA receptors. <cite class="reflink"><a href="#schaffer">Schaffer</a></cite>
            </p>
             
             
            <p> 
                 Taurine also uses calcium to help promote differentiation of neural progenitor cells (NPCs), leading to neurite outgrowth (neurogenesis), part of a regulated process in progenitors that allows for beneficial calcium entry without overstimulation, beneficial to the brain and cognitive health. <cite class="reflink"><a href="#gutierrez-castanada">Gutiérrez-Castañeda</a></cite>
            </p>
            
            <h5>Effects on Bone and Cartilage</h5>
            <p>
                Taurine stimulates osteogenesis (bone formation) and chondrogenesis (cartilage formation), improving bone density, development, and remodeling. It stimulates osteoblasts and inhibits osteoclasts, favoring osteocalcin production, signaling calcium uptake into bone. Taurine helps cartilage maintenance by increasing the synthesis of <abbr title="extracellular matrix">ECM</abbr> components, such as glycosaminoglycans and collagen, in chondrocytes. <cite class="reflink"><a href="#perez-hernandezn">Pérez-Hernández</a></cite>
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Taurine's osteogenic effects draw calcium from the blood, reducing excess extracellular calcium from damaging neurons or calcifying arteries. Because excess extracellular calcium can contribute to neuronal intracellular calcium overload, taurine's effects on intracellular and extracellular calcium strongly support mitochondrial protection and neuronal health in PD. <cite class="reflink"><a href="#w-q-chen">W Q Chen</a></cite>
            </p>
                
            <h4>Ergogenic Effects</h4>
            <p>
                 Taurine's calcium-regulating effects in both skeletal muscle and cardiac tissue significantly improve several performance metrics, including muscle force, lipid metabolism, and insulin sensitivity. A 2020 review found taurine supplementation improved anaerobic and aerobic performance metrics, including VO2 max, time to exhaustion, muscle damage, peak power, and recovery. <cite class="reflink"><a href="#kurtz">Kurtz</a></cite>
            </p>
            
            <p>
	            Taurine's osmolytic effects stabilize cell membranes and regulate electrolyte balance, which helps restore muscle cells to their resting state after intense physical activity. This stabilizing effect reduces muscle fatigue and oxidative stress post-exercise, improving exercise recovery.
            </p>
            
            <h4>Supplementation</h4>
            <p>
                 3 grams of taurine pre-workout safely improves performance, reduces cellular damage, and improves recovery. The high dose used on rodents in the Singh study (1000mg/kg/day for mice), translates to a higher, but still safe human dose of about 5.6g for a 70kg person (1000mg/kg×0.081 = 81mg/kg/day for humans).

				Citrulline malate is a 2:1 compound of L-citrulline, a non-essential amino acid, with malic acid to enhance absorption. It promotes vasodilation and circulation, exercise recovery, and is an intermediary in the urea cycle.
			</p>
			
			<h4>Pre-Workout Benefits</h4>
			<p>
				Citrulline malate works best when used as a pre-workout supplement, due to its ability to increase nitric oxide production, delay muscle fatigue, improve oxygen delivery, increase energy production, and help workout performance and recovery.
			</p>
			
			<h4>Anti-Oxidant Effects</h4>
			<p>
				 In a 2021 <abbr title="randomized controlled trial">RCT</abbr> on diabetic patients, L-citrulline supplementation increased the activity of antioxidant enzymes <abbr title="superoxide dismutase">SOD</abbr> and catalase, which neutralize reactive oxygen species (ROS). <cite class="reflink"><a href="#s-azizi">Azizi</a></cite>
			</p>
			
			<h4>Cognitive Effects</h4>
			<p>
				A three-month study on mice with Alzheimer's found that males given citrulline showed improved memory performance in maze tests, possibly due to higher arginine levels in cerebrospinal fluid. This suggests a nitric oxide-related benefit for cognitive function. <cite class="reflink"><a href="#martinez-gonzalez">Martínez-González</a></cite>
			</p>

			<p>
				Oral administration of L-citrulline was shown to prevent hippocampal neuron loss and capillary damage after brain ischemia in mice, likely due to restored expression of eNOS, nitric oxide synthase, in endothelim,  the layer of cells that line blood vessels and lymphatic vessels. This finding may have implications for neuroprotection in PD. <cite class="reflink"><a href="#yabuki">Yabuki</a></cite>
			</p>
			
			<h4>Supplementation</h4>
			<p>
				A pre-workout dose of 4-8 grams of citrulline malate effectively improves blood flow and recovery for most individuals without adverse effects. Start with a lower dose, adjusting based on body size and workout intensity. <cite class="reflink"><a href="#varvik">Vårvik</a></cite>

            <h4>Raw Cacao vs Cocoa (Processed Chocolate)</h4>
            <p>
                Raw cacao is made from cold-pressed, unroasted cocoa beans, preserving the nutritional content, in contrast to cocoa, which is heavily processed, roasted at high temperatures, and often has added sugar. 
            </p>
            
            <h4>Health Benefits</h4>
            <p>
                Raw cacao contains polyphenols and stimulants that contribute to its neuroprotective, cognitive, and physical performance-enhancing effects. Cacao's flavonoids improve blood flow, reduce inflammation, and provide antioxidant neuroprotection. Catechin and epicatechin may enhance neurotransmitter function. Stimulants like theobromine, caffeine, phenylethylamine (PEA), theophylline, tyramine, and anandamide, a natural endocannabinoid, all improve neurotransmitter function, alertness, and mood. Together, these compounds synergistically protect neurons to support cognitive function and physical performance, providing multifaceted benefits for conditions like PD.
            </p>
            
            <h4>Stimulants and Neurotransmitters</h4>
            <p>
                While cacao contains several stimulants, its overall effects are generally milder and more sustained compared to caffeine. Theobromine, in particular, has a slower onset and longer duration of action than caffeine. Phenylethylamine, tyramine, and anandamide are all endogenously produced neurotransmitters, also present in cacao, and are all significantly lowered in PD, which may contribute to disease progression. Consuming cacao improves these levels, and catechin and epicatechin may help prolong their effects.  <cite class="reflink"><a href="#g-zhou">Zhou</a></cite>
            </p>
            
            <h5>Phenylethylamine (PEA)</h5>
            <p>
                Phenylethylamine (PEA) is a naturally occurring neurotransmitter also present in cacao, but is significantly decreased in PD. PEA affects mood, attention, and motivation, and reduced levels seen in PD might contribute to the non-motor symptoms of mood, depression, and cognitive decline. <cite class="reflink"><a href="#miura">miura</a></cite>
            </p>
            
            <h5>Anandamide</h5>
            <p>
                Anandamide, a known endocannabinoid also present in cacao, is decreased in PD. By reducing NMDA receptor-mediated calcium influx through cannabinoid receptor-dependent mechanisms, anandamide might reduce the excitatory pathways that lead to calcium influx and damage dopaminergic neurons, which are calcium-sensitive and thus particularly vulnerable to excitotoxic damage in PD and exacerbated by DRT (see also: <a href="#impact-dopamine-agonists">Impact of DRT</a>). <cite class="reflink"><a href="#hampson">hampson</a></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
                GABAergic dysfunction in PD impairs inhibitory signaling, contributing to prolonged nueronal excitatory states. This leads to unregulated NMDA receptor activity and subsequent calcium overload. Anandamide helps this by modulating NMDA receptor activity and reducing calcium influx via cannabinoid receptor activation, helping to dampen glutamate-induced excitotoxicity, possibly reducing neuronal damage associated with GABAergic dysfunction and prolonged excitatory states. 
            </p>
            <h4>Cognitive Benefits</h4>
            <p>
                Studies on raw cacao show cognitive improvement in healthy individuals of various ages. A 2024 single-blind study from Japan examined the cognitive effects of high versus low polyphenol cacao. The high polyphenol group showed improvements in mental and physical fatigue, stress, boredom, sleepiness, motivation, healing, enjoyment, relaxation, concentration, and willingness after two sets of cognitive performance tests. <cite class="reflink"><a href="#r-lalonde">R. Lalonde</a>, <a href="#a-sasaki">A. Sasaki</a></cite>
            </p>
            
            <h4>Preparation</h4>
            <p>
                To maximize the health benefits of cacao, it should be consumed in its raw or minimally processed form, such as raw cacao paste or powder. Heat processing degrades beneficial flavonoids and other nutrients, so should be minimized during preparation. Additionally, added sugar not only diminishes the potential health benefits but also contributes to the formation of advanced glycation end-products (AGEs), which are associated with aging and various chronic diseases. Unsweetened, high-quality cacao is best for optimal health.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Cacao powder contains fat-soluble compounds but can be dissolved in hot water as a beverage with fats like coconut oil added.
            </p>
            <h4>Stimulatory Effects</h4>
            <p>
                Cacao contains theobromine (dimethylxanthine), a stimulant similar to caffeine but less methylated. Both bind to adenosine receptors in the brain, increasing activity and alertness, and can interfere with sleep. Therefore, it is advisable to avoid consuming cacao later in the day.
            </p>

                Cinnamon is a spice obtained from the inner bark of several species of trees. Ceylon cinnamon is preferred, as it contains no coumarin, a natural carcinogen. Cinnamon contains both water-soluble and fat-soluble compounds. Cinnamon's fat-soluble compounds include cinnamaldehyde and epicatechin and its water-soluble compounds include procyanidin type-A trimer, cinnamic acid, and various flavonoids. 
            </p>
            
            <h4>Antidiabetic Effects</h4>
            <p>
                Cinnamon exhibits anti-hyperglycemic properties, with the most significant effects observed in Ceylon cinnamon. These effects are species-specific.  <cite class="reflink"><a href="#n-j-hayward">N.J. Hayward</a></cite>

            <h4>Neuroprotective Effects</h4>
            <p>
                Glucose metabolism is impaired in PD. Improved glucose response and blood glucose levels from cinnamon's antidiabetic effects may benefit PD patients. <cite class="reflink"><a href="#a-marques">A. Marques</a></cite>

                Ingested cinnamon metabolizes to sodium benzoate (NaB). Both cinnamon and NaB upregulate neuroprotective molecules (Parkin and DJ-1) and protect the nigrostriatum in a mouse model. <cite class="reflink"><a href="#s-khasnavis">S. Khasnavis</a></cite>
            </p>
            
            <h4>Supplementation</h4>              
            <p>
                Translating the mouse dosage used in the Khasnavis study to a human dosage, using the study's 100 mg/kg to a 12x k-factor results in 1.2 g/kg. For a 50 lb human, this equates to 60 grams of cinnamon daily — an impractical amount. Consuming 3g daily is only 5% of the suggested dose, offering minimal neuroprotection. This small dose can be achieved by adding cinnamon to premixed powders such as the cacao mix, post-workout protein mix, and golden milk. Consuming CinnulinPF can achieve more optimal levels. <cite class="reflink"><a href="#d-patel">Patel</a></cite>

                        Ingestion of 3 g cinnamon reduced postprandial serum insulin and increased GLP-1 concentrations without significantly affecting blood glucose, GIP, ghrelin concentration, satiety, or GER in healthy subjects. The results indicate a relation between the amount of cinnamon consumed and the decrease in insulin concentration.

                Lion’s mane is a white, edible mushroom that grows on hardwood and has neuroprotective effects. It contains fat-soluble bioactive compounds, hericenones and erinacines, and water-soluble beta-glucans, which are found in the cell walls of various mushrooms, including lion's mane.
            </p>
            
            <h4>Beta-glucans</h4>
            <p>
                Beta-glucans, found in the cell walls of many mushrooms, including lion's mane and cordyceps, are potent immunomodulators that improve synaptic plasticity, provide neuroprotective effects, and enhance cognition and behavior. These effects are particularly relevant in PD, where cognitive decline and synaptic damage are common issues. <cite class="reflink"><a href="#c-cerletti">c-cerletti</a></cite>
            </p>
            
            <p>
                A 2022 study on mice found that mushroom-derived β-glucans significantly increased synaptic thickness in the prefrontal cortex (PFC), but β-glucans from oats and curdlan did not. <abbr title="Brain-derived neurotrophic factor">BDNF</abbr> and the post-synaptic protein 95 (PSD95) increased in the <abbr title="pre-frontal cortex">PFC</abbr> of all groups. <cite class="reflink"><a href="#hu">hu</a></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
                A 2015 rodent study demonstrated a decrease in α-synuclein levels in the substantia nigra of Parkinson’s disease rat models following beta-glucan administration. <cite class="reflink"><a href="#rahayu">Rahayu</a></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
                A pilot clinical trial involving children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) found that beta-glucan supplementation (Nichi Glucan) improved behavior and sleep patterns, along with increased melatonin levels. <cite class="reflink"><a href="#raghavan">Raghavan</a></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
                Beta-glucans improve gut microbiota and integrity, leading to a saccharolytic shift and increased short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs). This may have implications for PD, as alterations in gut microbiota have been linked to the condition. <cite class="reflink"><a href="#bhardwaj">bhardwaj</a></cite>
            </p>
            
            <h4>Hericinones and Erinacines</h4>
            <p>
                Hericenones and erinacines increase <abbr title="Brain-derived neurotrophic factor">BDNF</abbr> and NGF levels, promote neurite outgrowth, support neuronal survival, and enhance memory and cognitive function. <cite class="reflink"><a href="#koichiro-mori">Mori</a>, <a href="#sarah-docherty">Docherty</a></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
                However, in some studies, hericenones failed to promote NGF gene expression in human astrocytoma cells while <dfn>erinacine A</dfn> successfully upregulated them in rats. <cite class="reflink"><a href="#i-chen-li">Li</a></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
                A 2022 <abbr title="randomized controlled trial">RCT</abbr> found that lion's mane supplementation improved cognitive performance in elderly patients with mild cognitive impairment, potentially due to its positive effects on blood biomarkers and reduced brain structural deterioration in regions associated with memory. <cite class="reflink"><a href="#i-chen-li">Li</a></cite>
            </p>

            <h4>Lion's Mane in PD</h4>
            <p>
                Lion’s mane promotes neurogenesis through increased <abbr title="Brain-derived neurotrophic factor">BDNF</abbr> and <abbr title="Nerve Growth factor">NGF</abbr> activity, which helps regenerate neurons and improves cognitive function. <cite class="reflink"><a href="#koichiro-mori">Mori</a>, <a href="#i-chen-li">Li</a>, <a href="#sarah-docherty">Docherty</a>, <a href="#puei-lene-lai">Lai</a></cite>
            </p>
        
            <h4>Supplementation</h4>
            <p>
                Lion's mane is generally safe and well-tolerated at doses between 1-3 grams per day. When selecting reputable lion's mane supplements, look for brands that provide Certificates of Analysis (CoA) to ensure product quality and authenticity. Some well-regarded brands known for their quality and CoA include Nammex, Real Mushrooms, Host Defense, and Mushroom Science.

It is neuroprotective, anti-inflammatory, and has mitochondrial benefits. Its main bioactive components include cordycepin, adenosine, and beta-glucans (see discussion under <a href="#lions-mane">lion's mane</a>). <cite class="reflink"><a href="#tuli">Tuli</a></cite>
            </p>

                A systematic review on cordycepin, analyzing 192 studies, found strong, consistent evidence for its therapeutic potential for reducing tumor growth, protecting brain function, improving respiratory and cardiac health, and alleviating metabolic disorders. Cordycepin's demonstrated ability to reduce inflammation, improve mitochondrial function, and promote cell survival makes it a promising candidate for drug development, especially for age-related diseases. However, questions about its mechanism, toxicity, and biodistribution remain. <cite class="reflink"><a href="#radhi">Radhi</a></cite>
            </p>
            
            <h4>Cordycepin</h4>
            <p>
                Cordycepin, one of the bioactive components of cordyceps, reduces neuroinflammation by regulating cytokine production. Cytokine dysregulation is an etiological pathway of PD, whereby pro-inflammatory cytokines are upregulated and anti-inflammatory cytokines are downregulated. This imbalance exacerbates neuroinflammation, leading to increased tissue damage and neurological dysfunction. By modulating this cytokine balance, cordycepin helps mitigate inflammation and its associated damage in neurodegenerative conditions like PD. <cite class="reflink"><a href="#lazarro">Lazarro</a>, <a href="#radhi">Radhi</a></cite>
            </p>
            
            <p>
                A 2021 study published in The Journal of Neuroinflammation demonstrated that cordycepin provides long-term neuroprotection, preserves blood-brain barrier (BBB) integrity, and shifts the inflammatory response of brain immune cells (microglia and macrophages) from pro-inflammatory to anti-inflammatory. This study also found that cordycepin and adenosine modulate macrophage activity and enhance immune responses through mechanisms like phagocytosis (a process by which a cell engulfs a particle, such as a bacterium, dead cell, or foreign substance, and digests it). These findings present cordycepin and adenosine as promising candidates for brain inflammation. <cite class="reflink"><a href="#wei">Wei</a></cite>
            </p>

            <h5>Relevance to PD</h5>    
            <p>
                A 2020 study found that cordycepin protects brain cells in a PD mouse model by reducing inflammation and preventing certain types of harmful cell death. Cordycepin was again shown to block pathways that trigger the release of inflammatory chemicals known to damage neurons in PD. These findings suggest cordycepin could have potential as a treatment reduce to neuroinflammation in PD. <cite class="reflink"><a href="#y-sun">Sun</a></cite>
            </p>

            <h4>Cardiovascular Performance</h4>
            <p>
                A 2016 double-blind, placebo-controlled study found that supplementing with a Cordyceps militaris mushroom blend improved exercise performance over time. While one week of supplementation slightly improved time to exhaustion, three weeks led to significant gains in VO2 max, time to exhaustion, and ventilatory threshold, suggesting chronic use enhances exercise capacity and recovery.
            </p>

            <p>
                Given the benefits of high-intensity exercise for PD, improved exercise tolerance enables more frequent and intense sessions, for greater neuroprotective and physical benefits over time. <cite class="reflink"><a href="#hirsh">hirsh</a></cite>
            </p>                    
            
            <h4>BBB</h4>
            <p>
                Cordycepin is a small molecule (<abbr title="molecular weight">MW</abbr> ~251 <abbr title="Daltons &ndash; unit of molecular mass">Da</abbr>) that can cross the BBB and improve its tight junction. <cite class="reflink"><a href="#j-yuan">Yuan</a></cite>
            </p>
            
            <h4>Immunomodulation</h4>
            
            <p>
                Cordycepin and adenosine work together to regulate inflammation by modulating the immune response, balancing inflammatory and anti-inflammatory to reduce excess inflammation. <cite class="reflink"><a href="#s-shin">Shin</a>, <a href="#s-j-jung">Jung</a></cite>
            </p>
            
            <h4>Supplementation</h4>
            <p>
                Typical Dosage Range: 1,000 to 3,000 mg per day of Cordyceps extract, divided into two or three doses, taken pre-workout, in the morning for energy, exercise performance, and neurological benefits. To prevent potential sleep disturbances, it's best to avoid taking Cordyceps in the late afternoon or evening.
            </p>
            <p>                                     
                When selecting reputable Cordyceps supplements, look for brands that provide Certificates of Analysis (CoA) to ensure product quality and authenticity.

            <p>
                Turmeric, the rhizome of Curcuma longa, contains curcumin as its primary active compound along with other bioactives. Turmerones enhance the bioavailability of curcumin <cite class="reflink"><a href="#yue">Yue</a></cite>, while the curcuminoids bisdemethoxycurcumin and demethoxycurcumin complement its anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects. Together, these compounds synergistically reinforce the therapeutic benefits of turmeric.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Curcumin crosses the blood-brain barrier to reach deep brain structures, including the midbrain, to exert beneficial effects directly.
            </p>

            <h4>How Turmeric Helps PD</h4>
            <p>
                Turmeric promotes neuroprotection and neurogenesis, prevents α-synuclein aggregation, reduces neuronal iron deposition, and decreases oxidative stress. <cite class="reflink"><a href="#s-mishra">S Mishra</a></cite>
            </p>
                            
            <h4>Curcumin Improves Gait in PD Models</h4>
            <p>
                A 2022 rodent study on curcumin oil formulation found that it improved gait, providing evidence closely related to clinic practices on gait analysis. <cite class="reflink"><a href="#x-geng">X. Geng</a></cite>
            </p>
                
            <h4>Curcumin and α-Synuclein Aggregation</h4>
            <p>
                A 2012 study examined how curcumin affects α-synuclein aggregation. The researchers found that curcumin binds strongly to the protein, increasing its flexibility and movement, making it less likely to aggregate. By weakening the internal interactions within α-synuclein, curcumin allows the protein to reconfigure more quickly, preventing the formation of harmful clumps like oligomers and fibrils, which can eventually form into Lewy bodies. Curcumin mitigates this problem by preventing misfolding. <cite class="reflink"><a href="#b-ahmad">B. Ahmad</a></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
                A 2017 study on rats found other mechanisms by which curcumin improves upon α-synuclein aggregation. They found curcumin significantly improved inflammation, replenished <abbr title="Glutathione">GSH</abbr>, and prevented iron deposition and α-synuclein aggregation in dopaminergic neurons. <cite class="reflink"><a href="#n-sharma">N. Sharma</a></cite>
            </p>

            <h4>Challenges with Curcumin Absorption</h4>
            <p>
                Curcumin pills are convenient but poorly absorbed and rapidly metabolized. Frequent turmeric consumption throughout the day with fatty foods, black pepper or long pepper, and phosphatidylserine, fixes these problems.
            </p>
        
            <h4>Supplementation (Eating Turmeric)</h4>
            <p>
                Turmeric contains turmerones, which improve curcumin absorption. Consuming turmeric is generally safe at 1-10 g daily. However, very high doses may cause stomach upset or kidney strain, while lower doses may not be effective.
            </p>
            
            <h4>Self-Emulsifying Drug Delivery Systems SEDDS</h4>
            <p> 
                Self-emulsifying Drug Delivery Systems (SEDDS) are lipid-based formulations that create emulsions to improve the oral bioavailability of lipophilic substances found in turmeric. The increased bioavailability means that a greater effect can be achieved without increasing the dose, thereby reducing the risk of side effects from overconsumption.
            </p>
            
            <h4>Enhancing Absorption with Food</h4>
            <p>                         
                Food formulations offer better absorption by acting as a <abbr title="Self-emulsifying Drug Delivery Systems">SEDDS</abbr>. Turmeric is good in curries with coconut oil, eggs, and in the cacao mix, when blended with coconut oil or butter. Turmeric can be added to other dishes, like soups, or blended into warm milk as <dfn>"golden milk"</dfn> with saffron, cinnamon, and other spices, or mixed into mustard as a garnish. 
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Piperine and piper longumine, from black pepper and long pepper, respectively, also increase curcumin bioavailability, and the latter is also senolytic. <cite class="reflink"><a href="#k-kesarwani">K. Kesarwani</a></cite>
            </p>
                
            <h4>Supplementation Recommendations</h4>
            <p>
                Turmeric powder provides a convenient way to add turmeric to food and, as mentioned above, contains turmerones which improve curcumin's bioavailability. 
            </p>

            <h4>Safety Concerns</h4>
            <p>
                Turmeric thins the blood, which may increase the risk of bleeding, especially in individuals taking blood-thinning medications or those with bleeding disorders or who are planning surgery. It may interact with blood thinners, diabetes medications, and medications that reduce stomach acid production.
            </p>

            <p>
                Saffron is a spice made from the red stigmas or "threads" of the Crocus flower used in South Asian and Middle Eastern medicine as an <dfn title="substance that induces menstrual flow, even if it is delayed or absent.">emmenagogue</dfn>, general tonic, aphrodisiac, and nerve stimulant in low doses either in tea or in meals.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Saffron has antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and neuroprotective effects. Scientific research shows its beneficial effects on improving mood and sleep, enhancing cognitive function, and supporting cardiovascular health. The primary active components, such as crocin and picrocrocin, are water-soluble, while safranal, responsible for saffron's aroma, is fat-soluble.
            </p>
            
            <h4>Sleep</h4>
            <p>
            A 28-day, parallel-group, double-blind <abbr title="randomized controlled trial">RCT</abbr> recruited sixty-three healthy adults aged 18–70 with self-reported sleep problems who were randomized to receive either saffron or a placebo. Results showed that saffron was associated with greater improvements in the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI), Restorative Sleep Questionnaire (RSQ), and the Pittsburgh Sleep Diary (PSD) and was well-tolerated with no reported adverse effects. <cite class="reflink"><a href="#a-lopresti">A. Lopretsi</a></cite>
            </p>
            
            <h4>Saffron in Neurodegenerative Disease</h4>
            
            <p>
                Saffron has been proven to alleviate the symptoms of AD and its effects on PD are of continuing research, particularly for its antidepressant and anxiolytic effects. <cite class="reflink"><a href="#y-bian">Y. Bian</a></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
                A 2024 review found that saffron's compounds inhibit neuroinflammation and excitotoxic pathways, modulate autophagy and apoptosis, attenuate oxidative damage, and activate defensive antioxidant enzymes, providing neuroprotection against neurodegenerative diseases. <cite class="reflink"><a href="#hamedani">S. G.-Hamedani</a></cite>
            </p>
            
            <p>
                A 2019 rodent model study found saffron had a neuroprotective
effect and could be recommended as a possible therapeutic agent to prevent neurotoxicity allied to heavy metals and related neurodegenerative disorders like PD. <cite class="reflink"><a href="#tamegart">L. Tamegart</a></cite>
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Saffron inhibits damage and inflammation to astrocytes, a type of glial cell, through multiple pathways. Its active compounds modulate oxidative stress, reduce pro-inflammatory cytokine production, and support the maintenance of cellular integrity, thereby protecting astrocytes from injury and dysfunction. <cite class="reflink"><a href="#maqbool">Maqbool</a></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
                Glial cells, and specifically astrocytes, support the function and survival of neurons. Astrocytes can release neurotransmitters, such as glutamate and <abbr title="adenosine triphosphate">ATP</abbr>, which can influence neuronal activity.
            </p>
            <p>
                Glial scar formation is a common pathological feature in various central nervous system (CNS) diseases, including PD. In PD, the glial scars form around damaged dopaminergic neurons, blocking their repair.
            </p>
            
            <h4>Antifibrillogenic Effects</h4>
            <p>
                A few in vitro studies found that saffron dose-dependently inhibited α-synuclein aggregation and dissociated α-synuclein fibrils. Although the antifibrillogenic evidence is preliminary, daily consumption of saffron might help with this. Given its other more established beneficial effects and the mild to no side effects in moderate doses, there’s really no good reason not to enjoy this delicious, beautiful spice. <cite class="reflink"><a href="#saffari">Saffari</a>, <a href="#inoue">Inoue</a></cite>
            </p>
            
            <h4>Supplementation</h4>
            <p>
                Some of the compounds in saffron are fat-soluble, while others are water-soluble. Saffron can be drunk with turmeric and cinnamon in golden milk. Excessive amounts may cause bloating and gas and gut microbiota may positively affect the gut-brain axis, therefore, it's a good idea to consume saffron with prepared food.

            <p>
                Coconut oil is extracted from the meat of mature coconuts. It is high in saturated fats and commonly used in cooking and food preparations.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Rich in lauric acid and <abbr title="medium-chain triglyceride">MCTs</abbr>, coconut oil supports heart health by increasing HDL and providing antimicrobial effects. Lauric acid, a 12-carbon variety, may contribute to its positive effects on HDL. <abbr title="medium-chain triglyceride">MCTs</abbr> boost energy and enhance metabolic health, which can improve brain function and aid conditions like AD, PD, and MS. Additionally, coconut oil supports fat loss, nutrient absorption, and gut health.
            </p>
            
            <h4>Metabolic Health Effects</h4>
            <p>
                A 2018 double-blind <abbr title="randomized controlled trial">RCT</abbr> investigated the effects of various vegetable oils, including coconut, safflower, chia, and soybean (placebo) oils, on obese women following a hypocaloric diet.
            </p>
            <p>
                The coconut oil group showed significant improvements in cardiovascular risk factors, including reduced abdominal adiposity, decreased waist circumference, decreased waist-to-height ratio, lower blood glucose and glycated hemoglobin levels, reduced body fat, and increased lean mass. <cite class="reflink"><a href="#oliveira-de-lira">Oliveira de Lira</a></cite>
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The increase in lean mass was likely due to MCTs, which provide quick energy, enhance exercise performance, and stimulate muscle growth without promoting fat storage. Maintaining or increasing lean mass supports metabolic health and cardiovascular outcomes. The quick energy boost also makes coconut oil a good pre-workout option.
            </p>
            
            <h4>Mitigating PD</h4>
            
            <p>A 2022 review study found that coconut oil improves PD through multiple pathways, mediating oxidative stress, neuroinflammation, mitochondrial dysfunction, apoptosis, and excitotoxicity in various in vitro and in vivo models. Dietary intake of coconut oil has also been associated with a reduced incidence of PD. During digestion, coconut oil is broken down into smaller molecules, such as ketone bodies (KBs). These KBs can cross the <abbr title="blood-brain barrier">BBB</abbr> and serve as an alternative energy source for the brain, making coconut oil a significant natural remedy for neurodegenerative conditions. <cite class="reflink"><a href="#deepika">deepika</a></cite>
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Coconut oil has been shown to reduce obesity, improve insulin resistance, and support metabolic health. These improvements can reduce inflammation, enhance mitochondrial function, and increase cerebral blood flow. These effects may help explain how coconut oil potentially benefits neurodegenerative disorders such as AD, PD, and MS. <cite class="reflink"><a href="#oliveira-de-lira">Oliveira de Lira</a>, <a href="#ibrahim">Ibrahim</a></cite>
            </p>
            
            <h4>Mitochondrial Effects</h4>
            <p>
                Although progressive damage to dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra is a primary etiological pathway in PD, mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress contribute substantially to its pathogenesis. Coconut oil's <abbr title="medium-chain triglyceride">MCTs</abbr> are metabolized into glycerol and medium-chain fatty acids, which support mitochondrial <abbr title="adenosine triphosphate">ATP</abbr> production and may enhance mitochondrial biogenesis. <cite class="reflink"><a href="#ying-wang">Ying Wang</a></cite>
            </p>

            <p>
                A 2020 rodent model study even showed that coconut oil helped neural function and mitigated the effects of L-dopa supplementation, lending its use as a potential strategy to reduce reliance on <abbr title="dopamine replacement therapy">DRT</abbr>. <cite class="reflink"><a href="#shehata">Shehata</a></cite>

            <p>
                Ginger, a rhizome, contains healthful bioactive compounds  with neuroprotective and anti-inflammatory effects that are beneficial for PD.
            </p>
            
            <h4>Heated, Dried, or Cooked?</h4>
            <p>
                Fresh ginger contains gingerols, gingerone, trace amounts of kaempferol, quercetin, apigenin, naringenin, and the protease zingibain. Dried ginger contains no gingerone, which contributes to its flavor, and and less gingerols, which convert into shogaols and zingerone during drying, yielding greater antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects. Heat degrades zingibain and gingerone, losing the health effects of these compounds present in small quantities in fresh ginger. 
            </p>
            <p>
                For neuroprotective and anti-inflammatory effects, dried ginger's concentrated shogaols and zingerone may be better. Although fresh ginger offers broader health benefits.
            </p>
            
            <h4>Benefits in PD: 6-Shogaol</h4>
            <p>
                A 2022 review study titled <q>Elucidating the Beneficial Effects of Ginger (Zingiber officinale Roscoe) in Parkinson’s Disease</q>, conducted in Greece, analyzed the impact of ginger's bioactive compounds on PD. The study found that compounds such as 6-shogaol and 6-gingerol effectively prevent α-synuclein fibril aggregation and reduce oxidative stress, leading to less cellular damage in neurons and improving mitochondrial function, promoting energy production. 
            </p>
            
            <h4>Gastrointestinal and Digestive Help</h4>
            <p>
                Ginger supports gastrointestinal health and reduces systemic inflammation, which is neuroprotective. <cite class="reflink"><a href="#angelopoulou">Angelopoulou</a></cite> 
            </p>
            
            <h4>Calcium Dysregulation</h4>
            <p>
                Ginger extract has been shown to lower blood pressure through mild L-type <abbr title="voltage-gated calcium channel">VGCC</abbr> blocking, which improves vasodilation and reduces excess calcium influx. This can benefit brain blood flow and neuronal health, as excessive calcium entry into neurons and their mitochondria is is a problem in PD. <cite class="reflink"><a href="#ghayur">Ghayur</a></cite> 
            </p>
            
            <h4>Kaempferol's Effects in PD Models</h4>
            <h5>Antioxidant and Neuroprotective Effects</h5>
            <p>
                Kaempferol is anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, neuroprotective, anti-diabetic, cardioprotective, and antifibrillogenic, all of which are beneficial for PD. Ginger contains approximately 0.1% to 0.4% kaempferol, while capers contain significantly more; around 2%.
            </p> 
            <p>
                A 2020 study examined kaempferol's effects in a rat model of PD with four groups: a control group, 10 mg/kg of kaempferol, 20 mg/kg, and a positive control receiving levodopa. After treatment, apomorphine (used in advanced PD during "off" phases) was administered to assess rotational behavior.
            </p>
            <p>
                The study found that kaempferol significantly and dose-dependently improved antioxidant markers—catalase, glutathione (GSH), glutathione peroxidase (GPX), and superoxide dismutase (SOD)—indicating a strong causal relationship. Additionally, kaempferol reduced rotational dyskinesia in PD rats. <cite class="reflink"><a href="#x-pan">Pan</a></cite>
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Another study on kaempferol, this one out of Japan, published in 2021, revealed potent antifibrillogenic effects, providing significant protection against α-synuclein-related neurotoxicity and induced autophagy through an increase in the biogenesis of lysosomes, reducing the accumulation of α-synuclein and preventing neuronal cell death. <cite class="reflink"><a href="#inden">Inden</a></cite>
            </p>
            
            <h4>Supplementation</h4>
            <p>
                The human equivalent of the minimum 10 mg/kg kaempferol in rats is approximately 0.81 mg/kg, or 56.7 mg for a 70 kg person, which corresponds to about 35 g of fresh ginger or 3.5 g of dry ginger. This dose should also confer very mild cellular calcium-regulating effects and slight vasodilation with reduced blood pressure.
            </p>

            <h4>Bioactive Compounds</h4>
            <p>
                Matcha is a finely ground Japanese green tea powder rich in bioactives, including lutein, vitamin K, and polyphenols, particularly catechins like epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), and caffeine. EGCG exhibits potent antioxidant and neuroprotective effects that help mitigate oxidative stress, neuroinflammation, and neurodegeneration.
            </p>
            
            <h4>Cognitive Effects</h4>
            
            <p>
                A 2020 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial over 12 weeks on 15 men and 39 women found that Matcha improved cognitive function (<abbr title="Montreal Cognitive Assessment">MoCA</abbr> test), with the effects being more pronounced in women than in men, especially in the cognitive domain of language. Researchers speculated that this may be associated with physiological changes that accompany estrogen loss and menopause in elderly women, attributing the potential effects to matcha's EGCG, vitamin K, and lutein content. <cite class="reflink"><a href="#k-sakurai">Sakurai</a></cite>
            </p>
            
            <h4>Metabolic Effects</h4>
            <p>
                A 2017 review found that EGCG exhibited a wide range of therapeutic properties including anti-atherosclerosis, anti-diabetes, anti-inflammatory, and antioxidant effects. The reduction in plasma glucose and inflammatory markers and the inhibition of <abbr title="Reactive Oxygen Species">ROS</abbr> generation have multiple benefits to cardiopulmonary and neurological health. <cite class="reflink"><a href="#q-y-eng">Eng</a></cite>
            </p>

            <p>
                Low-dose EGCG and caffeine, two components of matcha, elicit substantial synergistic anti-obesity effects by improving gut microbiota and enhancing short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) production. The gut microbiota regulates obesity and metabolic disorders through various physiological pathways, including SCFAs and their receptors. These effects on the gut microbiota may help explain the metabolic and cognitive benefits associated with matcha consumption. <cite class="reflink"><a href="#zhu">Zhu</a></cite>
            </p>
            
            <h4>Anti-aggregant and Antifibrillogenic Effects</h4>
            <p>
                EGCG has been shown to inhibit the effects of preformed oligomers of α-synuclein and other proteins from damaging vesicle membranes and causing cytotoxicity in rat brains. <cite class="reflink"><a href="#lorenzen">Lorenzen</a>, <a href="#j-zhao">Zhao</a></cite>
            </p>
            
            <p>
                A few in vitro studies have explored EGCG's antifibrillogenic potential with positive results. EGCG has been shown to prevent the formation of amyloid plaques and the misfolding of disease proteins and prions. Researchers demonstrated that EGCG inhibits α-synuclein and amyloid-β fibrillogenesis and can disaggregate amyloid fibrils of α-synuclein in a dose-dependent manner. <cite class="reflink"><a href="#bieschke">bieschke</a>, <a href="#y-xu">Xu</a></cite>
            </p>
            
            <p>
                EGCG's anti-aggregant and antifibrillogenic effects in humans are not supported by clinical trials, primarily due to the difficulty and cost of such studies. However, positive evidence from in vitro and rodent studies suggests that regular consumption might have a dose-dependent effect, potentially slowing disease progression. Considering the minimal mild side effects, there is no strong reason not to include matcha or an EGCG supplement in a PD regimen.
            </p>
            
            <h4>Ceremonial-Grade Matcha</h4>
            <p>
                Ceremonial-grade matcha is made from the youngest tea leaves with higher concentrations of chlorophyll and lower fluoride content compared to culinary-grade matcha made from older leaves, which accumulate fluoride from the soil as they grow.
            </p>
            
            <h4>Fluoride and Oxalates Warning</h4>
            <p>
                Matcha also has moderate levels of oxalates with younger leaves having higher oxalate concentrations than older leaves. Oxalates can contribute to inflammation and kidney damage. Moderate amounts of quality ceremonial-grade matcha are safe for drinking (10 g of matcha contains approximately 60 mg of oxalate). Those seeking a much higher dose of EGCG and lutein without the fluoride and oxalate can consider supplemental EGCG.
            </p>
            
            <h4>Matcha Preparation</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Grade:</strong> Use ceremonial-grade matcha for higher polyphenols and less caffeine and fluoride.</li>
                <li><strong>Timing:</strong> Consume in the morning or early afternoon to avoid nighttime caffeine effects.</li>
                <li><strong>Water Temperature:</strong> Heat water to 160–175°F (70–80°C; well below boiling) to preserve polyphenols.</li>
                <li><strong>Milk:</strong> Avoid milk to maintain polyphenol effectiveness.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Reducing LIDs vs Too Much Caffeine</h4>
            <p>
                Caffeine was shown to reduce the risk of <abbr title="L-Dopa-induced dyskinesias">LIDs</abbr> in a large-scale clinical trail and its cohort <cite class="reflink"><a href="#willis">Willis</a></cite>. However, higher doses can increase the production of <abbr title="reactive oxygen species">ROS</abbr>, which exacerbates oxidative stress.
            </p>
            
            <h4>Dose and Supplementation</h4>
            <p>
                For caffeine-sensitive individuals, lower doses of matcha (1–2 g), paired with supplemental EGCG and theanine, offer a more balanced neuroprotective strategy. This combination allows for beneficial polyphenol intake while theanine mitigates caffeine’s stimulating effects, reducing the risk of excessive caffeine-induced ROS production and the potential exacerbation of LIDs. Higher doses (up to 5 g) earlier in the day may provide increased pre-workout energy without affecting sleep.
            </p>

            <p>
                Ginseng is a traditional herbal medicine used for energy and vitality, metabolic (<abbr title="blood glucose">BG</abbr>) and cardiovascular health, stress relief, sexual dysfunction, and cancer protection. Its ginsenoside components, primarily Rb1 and Rg1, and saponins have shown neuroprotective effects, alleviating PD symptoms and slowing disease progression.
            </p>
            
            <h4>Ginseng and Physical Performance</h4>
            <p>
                 In a placebo controlled trial, panax ginseng administered 1 hour  before endurance performance increased lipolysis, eased heart rate, and reduced plasma lactate concentrations. <cite class="reflink"><a href="#cpf-wong">Wong</a></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
                A 2022 review assessed dose responses of ginseng at low (&lt;300 mg/day) and high (&gt;300 mg/day), and found that ginseng showed significant short-term effects (up to 4 weeks) at high dosage for vertical jump. <cite class="reflink"><a href="#khan">Khan</a></cite>
            </p>
            
            <h4>Mitochondrial Mechanism of Action?</h4>
            <p>
                 A 2020 rodent study found that red ginseng improves exercise endurance. Rats were fed ginseng and subjected to a swim test, testing time to exhaustion. Rats fed RG had significantly longer swimming endurance. Analysis showed RG treatment enhanced ATP production levels in myoblasts and RG increased mRNA expressions of mitochondrial biogenesis regulators, suggesting mitochondrial energy-generating capacity, which would also explain the improved exercise performance. <cite class="reflink"><a href="#shin">Shin</a></cite>
            </p>
            
            <h4>Intracellular Calcium Reduction</h4>
            <p>
                Ginseng was shown to protect mitochondria by reducing intracellular calcium through increased phosphorylation of <abbr title="inositol triphosphate receptor">IP3R</abbr> <cite class="reflink"><a href="#kwon">Kwon</a></cite>. This is helpful, because in PD, excess intracellular calcium damages mitochondria, exacerbating oxidative stress, disrupting ATP production, and causing neuronal damage. Ginseng helps this by reducing excess intracellular calcium, thereby protecting mitochondria and the neurons they function in.
            </p>
            <p>
                 Secondarily, ginsenoside Rb1 extract has demonstrated inhibition of L-type calcium channels (LTCCs) in rodent studies. <abbr title="L-type calcium channel">LTCC</abbr> blocking helps keep excess calcium from entering the cell, thereby preventing excess intracellular calcium. However, significant calcium channel blocking from ginseng alone would require a human dose of ginseng thirty times that of typical supplementation, which may contribute to ginseng's neuroprotective effects, and can complement other mild calcium channel blockers, like ginger.  <cite class="reflink"><a href="#z-lin">Zhi-ying Lin</a></cite>
            </p>

            <h4>Ginseng in PD</h4>
            <p>
                Ginseng improved motor function and increased dopamine levels in PD models. These neuroprotective effects are explained by reduced oxidative stress, neuroinflammation, α-synuclein aggregation, and neuronal apoptosis, with no significant toxicity observed in most studies. <cite class="reflink"><a href="#he">He</a>, <a href="#ong">Ong</a>, <a href="#l-song">Song</a>, <a href="#zaafan">Zaafan</a>, <a href="#van-kampen">van-kampen</a>, <a href="#jh-choi">Choi</a></cite>
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Ginsenoside Rb1 inhibits fibrillation, oligomerization, and toxicity of α-synuclein, and disaggregates preformed fibrils.  <cite class="reflink"><a href="#y-heng">Heng</a>, <a href="#ardah">Ardah</a></cite>
            </p>
            
            <h4>Supplementation</h4>
            <p>
                Ginseng's energizing effects make it suitable for pre-workout or earlier in the day. Fermented ginseng offers significantly better absorption with higher ginsenoside concentration, compared to the low oral absorption of non-fermented ginsenosides (0.1 – 3.7%). <cite class="reflink"><a href="#j-ryu">Ryu</a></cite> Start with 200-400 mg of 10% ginsenoside powder daily, gradually increasing the dose as needed. Select a high-quality product with clear labeling.

                Side effects may include a mildly elevated heart rate, increased blood pressure, and insomnia if consumed in the evening. Ginseng may enhance the activity of MAOIs, which could allow for reductions in medication dosage. Consult a healthcare professional for potential interactions and monitoring. <cite class="reflink"><a href="#l-liu">l-liu</a></cite>

            <p>
                Acetyl-L-Carnitine (ALCAR) is a modified form of L-Carnitine, an amino acid that transports fatty acids into the mitochondria for energy.
            </p>
            
            <h4>Blood-Brain Barrier</h4>
            <p>
                ALCAR’s acetyl group allows it to cross the blood-brain barrier more effectively than L-carnitine, enhancing brain energy metabolism and cognitive function.
            </p>
            
            <h4>How ALCAR Works</h4>
            <p>
                ALCAR facilitates the transport of fatty acids into mitochondria, boosting energy production decreases and reducing oxidative stress. This helps boost brain energy and neurotransmitter activity. Therapeutic benefits may include improved cognitive function, potential support for depression, reduced oxidative stress, and fat loss.
            </p>
            
            <h4>Performance and Recovery</h4>
            <p>
                Forms of l-carnitine, including ALCAR, improve exercise performance and recovery. A 2018 study published in the Journal of Exercise Nutrition and Biochemistry found that L-carnitine supplementation enhances exercise performance while attenuating blood lactate and oxidative stress responses to resistance training. <cite class="reflink"><a href="#koozehchian">Koozehchian</a></cite>
            </p>
            
            <p>
                A comprehensive 2018 review in Nutrients analyzed multiple studies across various populations, concluding that l-carnitine intake improves recovery after exercise, alleviates muscle injury, and reduces markers of cellular damage and free radical formation accompanied by attenuation of muscle soreness. Studies in older adults further showed that l-Carnitine supplementation can lead to increased muscle mass accompanied by a decrease in body weight and reduced physical and mental fatigue. <cite class="reflink"><a href="#fielding">Fielding</a></cite>
            </p>
            
            <h4>Fat Loss</h4>
            <p>
                Two other meta-analyses of high-quality <abbr title="randomized controlled trial">RCT</abbr>s found that 2 g l-carnitine supplementation improved body weight and fat mass, especially in overweight subjects. These results can be explained by carnitine's effects on energy production.  <cite class="reflink"><a href="#askarpour">Askarpour</a>, <a href="#talenezhad">Talenezhad</a></cite>
            </p>
            
            <h4>Metabolic Health</h4>
            <p>
                A 2021 review study investigated the effects of L-Carnitine, ALCAR, and Propionyl-L-Carnitine (PLCAR) on body mass in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) patients. After reviewing several studies, they concluded that 2 g/day l-carnitine for at least 2 weeks affects body mass in T2DM patients, and no differentiating effects were found in acetyl-l-carnitine or propionyl-l-carnitine groups. <cite class="reflink"><a href="#dd-wang">Wang</a></cite>
            </p>
            
            <h4>Neurological Effects</h4>

            <p>
                ALCAR protects dopaminergic neurons by reducing neuroinflammation, apoptosis, astrogliosis (damage to  astrocytes (glial cells)), and oxidative stress. ALCAR has shown neuroprotective effects in rodent models of PD, both in vitro and in vivo, protecting cells against the accumulation of alpha-synuclein. <cite class="reflink"><a href="#s-a-majd">Majd</a>, <a href="#burks">S Burks</a></cite> 
            </p>
            
            <p>
                A 1990 study on PD patients showed that 2g of ALCAR improved the H-reflex and enhanced sleep architecture, including spindle activity, in non-placebo subjects.
            </p>
            <p>
                Researchers found that the 2 g of supplemental ALCAR improved the H-response, sleep stages, and spindling in test (non-placebo) subjects. The H-response, or Hoffmann reflex, is a muscle reflex response to specific nerve stimulation, measured by latency and amplitude. Spindling refers to brain wave activity occurring during <abbr title="Non-rapid eye movement sleep">NREM</abbr> sleep, particularly in stages N2 (lighter sleep) and N3 (deeper sleep). <cite class="reflink"><a href="#puca">Puca</a></cite>
            </p>
            
            <p>
                A later 2018 multicenter, randomized double-blind, placebo-controlled 28-day clinical trial studied the efficacy of 1500 mg ALCAR per day in patients with cerebrovascular dementia. Although the study excluded patients with PD, researchers found that 1.5g of ALCAR significantly improved cognitive assessment. <cite class="reflink"><a href="#ys-yang">ys-yang</a></cite>
            </p>
            
            <p>
                A 2022 randomized, observational, double-blind, placebo-controlled study on ALCAR scheduled prefrail elderly patients. 92 patients received 3 months of treatment with ALCAR at 1.5 grams or placebo, twice daily, and then 3 months of follow-up. They found that ALCAR treatment delayed the incidence and severity of onset of degenerative disorders of the elderly in prefrail subjects with improvement in memory and cognitive processes. <cite class="reflink"><a href="#malaguarnera">Malaguarnera</a></cite>
            </p>
            
            <p>
                ALCAR supports exercise performance and recovery, mitochondrial health, cognitive function, and fat loss via its energy-producing effects in the mitochondria. Cognitive function is improved in the elderly, likely due to ALCAR's ability to stimulate mitochondrial energy production.
            </p>
            
            <h4>Supplementation</h4>
            <p>
                Taking 1.5 - 2 g ALCAR pre-workout enhances exercise performance. Intense exercise increases cerebral blood flow, potentially enhancing ALCAR uptake in the brain. It is avoid taking ALCAR before sleeping, as its stimulating effects may interfere with sleep.

            <p>
                Alpha-Lipoic Acid (ALA) improves mitochondrial function and reduces oxidative damage. <cite class="reflink"><a href="#j-liu">J. Liu</a></cite>
            </p>
            
            <h4>Supplement Forms: s- and r-Enantiomers, and Binding</h4>

            <p>
                Most research on ALA uses both s- and r-isoforms. The naturally-occurring r-form has higher absorption and bioavailability than the synthetically produced s-form. <cite class="reflink"><a href="#b-salehi">B. Salehi</a></cite>
            </p>
            
            <h5>Na-r-ALA — Increased Absorption</h5>
            <p>
                Despite its advantages, free-form r-ALA is still prone to polymerization. Na-r-ALA (sodium-bound r-ALA) is comparatively more stable, less prone to polymerization, and has better absorption compared to free-form r-ALA. Lysine R-lipoate may offer greater absorption compared to r-ALA. <cite class="reflink"><a href="#d-a-carlson">D.A. Carlson</a></cite>
            </p>

            <h4>How R-ALA Works</h4>
            
            <p>
                R-ALA activates <abbr title="AMP-activated protein kinase">AMPK</abbr> which stimulates mitophagy. This leads to mitochondrial biogenesis and improved mitochondrial function. It increases glucose uptake and decreases glucose production in the liver, resulting in enhanced insulin sensitivity and reduced oxidative stress. <cite class="reflink"><a href="#y-wang">Y. Wang</a>, <a href="#w-j-lee">W. J. Lee</a></cite>
            </p>
            
            <h4>R-ALA in Parkinson's Disease</h4>
            <p>
                 Insulin resistance (IR) is commonly associated with an increased risk of developing Parkinson’s disease. IR leads to elevated brain glucose, which damages brain cells and accelerates neurodegeneration. <cite class="reflink"><a 
         href="#e-hogg">E. Hogg</a></cite>
            </p>
            
            <h5>Iron in Parkinson's Disease</h5>
            <p>
                Alpha-synuclein pathology disrupts iron homeostasis in PD. High iron levels harm dopaminergic neurons, inducing cell death and leading to more severe motor deficits with mutant α-synuclein. <cite class="reflink"><a 
         href="#f-jia">f-jia</a>, <a 
         href="#p-lingor">p-lingor</a></cite>
            </p>
            
            <p>
                ALA's mitochondrial and antioxidant benefits are ideal for PD. <cite class="reflink"><a href="#j-liu">J. Liu</a></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
                R-ALA decreases intracellular <abbr title="Reactive Oxygen Species">ROS</abbr> and iron levels. <cite class="reflink"><a 
         href="#s-tai">S. Tai</a></cite>
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Overexpression of α-synuclein inhibits <abbr title="Adenosine 5′ Monophosphate-Activated Protein Kinase">AMPK</abbr> activity, contributing to the neurodegenerative process in PD. ALA increases AMPK, which improves mitochondrial function — a problem in PD. A rodent model experiment showed that treatment with acetyl-L-carnitine or α-lipoic acid improved motor performance, reduced oxidation, and improved ATP production. <cite class="reflink"><a href="#w-bobela">W. Bobela</a>, <a 
         href="#s-zaitone">S. Zaitone</a>, <a href="#h-zhang">H. Zhang</a></cite>
            </p>
            
            <h4>Synergy: Na-r-ALA, Creatine, ALCAR, and Carbohydrates</h4>
            
            <p>
                R-ALA, an antioxidant, helps protect the mitochondria from damage, allowing them to function more efficiently. <cite class="reflink"><a 
         href="#h-zhang">H. Zhang</a></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
                Combining ALCAR, r-ALA, and creatine amplify each other's effects, making this combination a potent pre-workout mitochondrial activator. <cite class="reflink"><a href="#d-g-burke">D.G. Burke</a></cite>
            </p>
            <h4>Side Effects</h4>
            <p>
                Gastrointestinal upset can occur. Some individuals experience this when taking Na-r-ALA on a full stomach, but not when taking r-ALA in the morning with water and fruit.

                        This study suggests that ALA-induced improvement of insulin sensitivity is mediated by activation of AMPK and reduced triglyceride accumulation in skeletal muscle.

            <h3>GABA, 5-HTP, and Melatonin</h3>
            <p>
                GABA, 5-HTP, and melatonin can help PD patients through multiple neurological pathways. They're grouped because they all promote sleep and should all be taken at night.
            </p>
            <h4>Dopaminergic, Serotonergic, and GABAergic Systems</h4>
            <p>
                PD affects the dopaminergic, serotonergic, and GABAergic systems, which are interdependent. Doctors typically focus on the dopaminergic system, leading to imbalances in other systems, nutrient deficiencies, and progressive neurodegeneration (PN). 
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Addressing only the dopaminergic system without considering the broader neurochemical landscape results in inadequate management of PD symptoms, exacerbates non-motor symptoms, and leads to treatment-related complications.
            </p>

            <h4>Comprehensive PD Management</h4>
            <p>
                A comprehensive approach to PD must consider not only the direct effects of medications but also their broader implications for nutritional status and metabolic function for improved outcomes and quality of life.
            </p>
            
            <h4>Medical Team Awareness</h4>
            <p>
                All medical team members must understand the broader implications of PD treatments to prevent nutrient depletion and exacerbation of neurodegeneration.

                    GABA is an inhibitory neurotransmitter that regulates dopaminergic neuron activity in the brain. 
                </p>
                
                <h4>GABA and Sleep</h4>
                <p>
                    GABA supplementation improves sleep by interacting with neurotransmitter systems in both the enteric nervous system (ENS) of the gastrointestinal tract and peripheral nervous system (PNS) receptors in the brainstem. This interaction influences the vagus nerve, leading to relaxation and better sleep quality.
                </p>

                <h4>GABA and L-Theanine Synergy</h4>
                <p>
                    A 2019 rodent model study found that a GABA and L-theanine mixture has positive synergistic effects on sleep quality and duration compared to either intervention alone. <cite class="reflink"><a href="s-kim">Kim</a></cite>
                </p>

                <p>
                    A 2021 review study published in Neuroscience discussed how some clinical manifestations (such as cognitive dysfunctions, attention deficits, etc.) emerge after abnormalities in the GABAergic system are accompanied with concomitant neurological diseases, including PD. <cite class="reflink"><a href="w-zhang">Zhang</a></cite>
                </p>
                
                <h4>GABA and Dopaminergic Side Effects</h4>
                <p>
                    In PD, the loss of GABAergic neurons in the substantia nigra contributes to motor symptoms. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    Dyskinesia is a common side effect of long-term treatment with levodopa in Parkinson’s disease. GABA supplementation at 1000mg daily has the potential to help regulate dopamine release and likely ameliorate dyskinesia. 
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    Non-pharmacological approaches, such as physical therapy and deep brain stimulation (DBS) targeting GABAergic circuits, may also help manage motor complications.

                    5-HTP (5-Hydroxytryptophan) is an amino acid that converts to serotonin (5-HT) and then to melatonin, a hormone that helps regulate sleep and relaxation.

                <p>
                    Serotonin signaling changes occur early in Parkinson's. Addressing this system early, before gastrointestinal symptoms appear is important.

                <h4>DRT Side Effect Counterbalance</h4>
                <p>
                    DRT can cause involuntary movements called L-DOPA-induced dyskinesia (LID). 5-HTP supplementation helps restore serotonin levels and modulate dopamine release, which can reduce the severity of symptoms associated with LID.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    DRT depletes vitamin B6, which is necessary for nerve health and neurotransmitter synthesis, leading to neuropathy and neurotransmitter system failure. Vitamin B12 deficiency can also contribute to neuropathy.

                <h4>Mitigating Serotonergic Damage in PD</h4>
                <p>
                    PD affects not only the dopaminergic system but also other neurotransmitter systems, including the serotonergic system, by the same mechanisms that affect the CNS (mitochondrial dysfunction, α-synuclein aggregation, etc.). This leads to the degeneration of serotonergic terminals, non-motor symptoms, and complications such as gastrointestinal dysfunction and, in some cases, visual hallucinations.

                <p>
                    Neurotransmitter metabolic pathways are complex. These interactions, illustrated in the figure <q>Competitive Neurotransmitter Inhibitors</q>,  function normally in healthy individuals but are disrupted in PD and further affected by <abbr title="Dopamine Replacement Therapy">DRT</abbr>. <cite class="reflink"><a href="#a-munoz">a-munoz</a>, <a href="#m-hinz">m-hinz</a></cite>

                    The impact of PD on the serotonergic system is significant and often overlooked by conventional medicine approaches. Several studies have shown serotonergic dysfunction in Parkinson's disease is associated with the development of motor and non-motor symptoms and complications. <cite class="reflink"><a href="#m-politis">Politis</a></cite>
                </p>

                <p>
                    5-HTP has demonstrated neuroprotective effects in humans and in animal models of neurodegenerative diseases, including PD. It reduces oxidative stress, inflammation, and mitochondrial dysfunction, which are primary etiological pathways in progressive neurodegeneration (PN).
                </p>
                
                <h4>Supplementation</h4>
                <p>
                    A 50 mg dose of 5-HTP is typically safe and well-tolerated. PD patients should consult their care team, as DRT and 5-HTP dosages may require careful adjustment. Taking it nightly is a conservative approach to improve sleep, depression, and constipation, reduce LIDs, provide neuroprotection, and balance neurotransmitter systems. 
                </p>

                <h4>Contraindication</h4>
                <p>
                    5-HTP elevates serotonin levels without the body's typical feedback mechanisms. Serotonergic imbalance affects other neurotransmitters like dopamine and norepinephrine that share precursor pathways (tryptophan and tyrosine, respectively). The magnitude of this risk depends on dosage, medications, and individual factors. Moderate caution should be exercised. Individuals who take SSRIs or MAOIs, or have a history of serotonin-related disorders should communicate this with their healthcare providers. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    In rodent studies, high doses of 5-HTP (150 mg/kg) have compromised the blood-brain barrier (BBB). In humans, this would roughly translate to 850 mg/day for a 70 kg individual, though this is purely hypothetical and not clinically recommended. <cite class="reflink"><a href="#a-sharma">A.

                        PD is characterized by the progressive loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra. However, other non-dopaminergic neuronal systems such as the serotonergic system are also involved. Serotonergic dysfunction is associated with non-motor symptoms and complications, including anxiety, depression, dementia, and sleep disturbances.

                    Melatonin is a hormone produced by the pineal gland, a small endocrine gland located in the midbrain between the two hemispheres.
                </p>
            
                <h5>Neuroprotective</h5>
                <p>
                    Melatonin protects neurons against oxidative stress, a problem exacerbated by PD. It interacts with nuclear receptors and signaling pathways to regulate gene transcription. This causes an increase in the production of superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione peroxidase, and glutathione reductase.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                     Neuroinflammation leads to increased ROS production. Increased ROS production contributes to neuronal damage which perpetuates further neuroinflammation. Melatonin reduces inflammation, thereby reducing oxidative stress.
                </p>
                
                <h5>Antioxidant Effects</h5>
                <p>
                    Melatonin easily crosses the BBB and stimulates a variety of antioxidative enzymes including superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione peroxidase and glutathione reductase, which scavenge free radicals, reducing the oxidative burden on cells and allowing antioxidant enzymes to function more efficiently. <cite class="reflink"><a href="#reiter">Reiter</a></cite>
                </p>

                <p>
                    SOD is one of the most important antioxidant enzymes inside and outside cell membranes. However, in PD, <abbr title="superoxide dismutase ">SOD</abbr> levels decline, and melatonin's restorative effects may help counteract this deficit. <cite class="reflink"><a href="#bostantjopoulou">Bostantjopoulou</a>, <a href="#yang">Yang</a></cite>
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    Melatonin receptors MT1 and MT2 in the substantia nigra are reduced in PD patients, however supplementing it helps amend this deficit. <cite class="reflink"><a href="#jw-shin">Shin</a></cite> 
                </p>

                <h5>Vasodilation Effects</h5>
                <p>                
                    Brain ischemia, a common problem in PD, occurs when blood flow and oxygen supply are restricted to various parts of the brain. Worse, ischemia to the substantia nigra exacerbates the problem of decreased dopamine output. This impairs mitochondrial function, leading to energy depletion and cell death. Melatonin is vasodilatory effects, relaxing blood vessels, and improving blood flow. This may help improve perfusion to ischemic brain regions, potentially reducing tissue damage and promoting recovery.

                    Melatonin protects mitochondrial function and integrity, mitigating cellular damage caused by ischemia.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A 2005 review concluded that melatonin preserves mitochondrial homeostasis, reduces free radical generation by enhancing mitochondrial glutathione levels, and safeguards proton potential and ATP synthesis by stimulating complex I and IV activities. <cite class="reflink"><a href="#srinivasan">Srinivasan</a></cite> 
                </p>
                
                <h5>Supplementation</h5>
                <p>
                    Melatonin is safe to take. Excessive doses over 10-15mg may cause next-day tiredness and headache.

                <p>
                    Time-released formulations help maintain melatonin levels for a longer period. The reduced peak concentration helps maintain sleep throughout the night.

                L-theanine, an amino acid found in green tea, has neuroprotective, mood-improving, and sleep-promoting effects that can help PD.
            </p>
            
            <h4>Cognitive Effects</h4>
            <p>
                A 2021 double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study in Japan evaluated the effects of 100.6 mg of L-theanine taken daily for 12 weeks in participants aged 50–69 years.
            </p>
            <p>
                The theanine group showed improved attention, reaction times, working memory, and executive function–higher-level cognitive skills for decision-making, problem-solving, and adapting to new situations. <cite class="reflink"><a href="#baba">Baba</a></cite> 
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Another double-blind, crossover <abbr title="randomized controlled trial">RCT</abbr> in Japan investigated the effects of 200 mg/day of L-theanine over four weeks on stress and cognitive function in healthy adults.
            </p> 
            <p>
                In a double-blind, crossover <abbr title="randomized controlled trial">RCT</abbr>, 200 mg/day of L-theanine for four weeks improved cognitive function, verbal fluency, and executive function in healthy adults aged 36–60. Cognitive function, verbal fluency and executive function scores improved after L-theanine administration. The study's crossover design and methodologies supports their findings that L-theanine can promote mental health in the general population with stress-related cognitive impairments. <cite class="reflink"><a href="#hidese">Hidese</a></cite> 
            </p>
            
            <h4>Effects on Sleep</h4>
            <p>
                Another crossover <abbr title="Randomized Controlled Trial">RCT</abbr> from Japan investigated chronic L-theanine administration on stress-related symptoms and cognitive function in a non-clinical population. 
                
            </p>
            <p>
                Subjects were randomly assigned to L-theanine (200 mg/day) or placebo tablets for 4 weeks. After a 2 week wash-out, the crossover study was continued for 4 weeks. Results showed the L-theanine group experienced shorter sleep latency, reduced sleep disturbances, and decreased reliance on sleep medication. <cite class="reflink"><a href="#kunugi">Kunugi</a></cite> 
            </p>
            
            <h4>Mechanism of Action</h4>
            <p>
                 L-theanine has been found to inhibit the NMDA receptor pathway, thereby preventing excessive glutamate-induced calcium influx and subsequent neuronal damage (Di et al., 2010). Theanine has potential competitively bind to glutamate receptors in the nervous system and may increase GABA levels. <cite class="reflink"><a href="#nathan">Nathan</a></cite>
            </p>
            
            <h4>Supplementation</h4>
            <p>
                L-theanine is considered very safe, with a recommended dose of 100–200 mg taken about 30 minutes before bedtime. An additional daytime dose may enhance mental clarity or counterbalance the stimulating effects of caffeine. Theanine can be taken with GABA for their combined effects on sleep.

            <p>
                TMG (trimethylglycine), also known as betaine, is a natural compound in the body and found in various foods. It helps convert homocysteine into methionine, a process that may reduce inflammation linked to PD. <cite class="reflink"><a href="#sleeman">Sleeman</a>, <a href="#murray">Murray</a>, <a href="#bhattacharjee">Bhattacharjee</a></cite>
            </p>   
                     
            <p>
                High homocysteine levels contribute to oxidative stress and inflammation, damaging neurons and blood vessels, including those in the brain.
            </p>    
            <h4>DRT Elevates Homocysteine</h4>
            <p>
                Levodopa metabolism in the liver raises homocysteine levels, potentially worsening neurological and vascular risks in PD. Lowering homocysteine may help mitigate these risks in patients on DRT. <cite class="reflink"><a href="#kocer">Kocer</a></cite>
            </p>    
            
            <h4>TMG or B Vitamins?</h4>

                TMG supports methylation alongside B6, B12, and folate by lessening B-vitamin demand, particularly in individuals with high methylation demands, like those on DRT. <cite class="reflink"><a href="#machek">Machek</a></cite>

            <h4>TMG Raises Glutathione</h4>
            <p>
                TMG indirectly supports glutathione synthesis, as methionine produced from TMG can convert to SAMe, a precursor to glutathione, an important antioxidant. <cite class="reflink"><a href="#g-zhao">Zhao</a></cite>

            <h4>Glycine Support</h4>
            <p>
                When TMG donates a methyl group to homocysteine, a small amount of glycine is released, which helps promote relaxation by acting on NMDA receptors in the brain.

            <h4>Osmotic Balance</h4>

            <p>
                TMG helps cells maintain a healthy balance of water and solutes, potentially protecting neurons from stress. As a stabilizing osmolyte, TMG supports the maintenance of native protein structures, helping to reduce cellular stress and the likelihood of protein misfolding—a process linked to neurodegenerative diseases like PD. However, these osmolytic effects are not unique to TMG. Other osmolytes, such as taurine, creatine, glycerol, and glycine, contribute to cellular stability in similar ways. By stabilizing proteins and maintaining cellular hydration, osmolytes like these may collectively support brain health by reducing the conditions that lead to protein aggregation and cellular dysfunction. <cite class="reflink"><a href="#knight">Knight &amp; Knight</a>, <a href="#kushwah">Kushwah</a></cite>

                <p>
                    Pyrroloquinoline Quinone (PQQ) is a naturally occurring coenzyme manufactured by bacteria, found in plants in tiny amounts, and utilized by mammalian cells as an important nutritional growth factor. PQQ is not produced endogenously in humans.
                </p>

                <p>
                    PQQ activates the signaling pathway involving the transcription factor PGC-1α (peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1-alpha), which promotes the formation of new mitochondria. This increases the number and efficiency of mitochondria in cells, improving cellular energy production. <cite class="reflink"><a href="#w-chowanadisai">W. Chowanadisai</a>, <a href="#p-hwang">P. Hwang</a></cite>
                </p>

                <h4>Brain Health</h4>
                <p>
                    Neurologically, PQQ increases blood flow to the cerebral cortex, protects against cell damage, promotes nerve growth factor (NGF) production, and prevents neurodegeneration caused by oxidative stress. These combined effects improve upon cognitive deficits from oxidative damage and senescence, and enhance memory, attention, cognition, learning, and mood. <cite class="reflink"><a href="#k-ohwada">K. Ohwada</a>, <a href="#k-shiojima">K. Shiojima</a>, <a href="#m-tamakoshi">M. Tamakoshi</a>, <a href="#k-ikemoto">K. Ikemoto</a></cite>
                </p>
                
                <h4>Cardiovascular Health</h4>
                <p>
                     By reducing oxidative stress and inflammation, PQQ supports endothelial function and protects against damage to blood vessels. PQQ has been shown to improve LDL levels, probably by the enzyme <abbr title="AMP-activated protein kinase">AMPk</abbr>, which regulates blood lipid levels, and to significantly decrease the levels of plasma C-reactive protein and <abbr title="interleukin 6">IL-6</abbr>. <cite class="reflink"><a href="#c-harris">C. Harris</a>, <a href="#m-nakano">M. Nakano</a>, <a href="#y-huang">Y. Huang</a></cite> 
                </p>
            
                <p>
                    PQQ helps prevent the formation of &alpha;-synuclein fibrils in vitro. However, these antifibrillogenic effects in humans, from supplementation, are unproven and questionable, as PQQ's ability to cross the BBB has not been established. 
                    <cite class="reflink"><a href="#m-kobayashi">M. Kobayashi</a>, <a href="#j-kim">J. Kim</a></cite> 
                </p>
                
                <h4>Blood-Brain Barrier (BBB)</h4>
                <p>
                    PQQ's cognitive and neurological effects could be achieved either through indirect mechanisms, undetermined transport proteins might facilitate the passage of PQQ across the BBB, metabolites that can cross the BBB and exert beneficial effects on brain function, or a combination of things. 
                </p>
                <p> 
                    PQQ's effects do involve enhanced systemic energy metabolism, reduced inflammation, increased antioxidant capacity, stimulation of neurotrophic factors, improved vascular health, and gut-brain axis modulation. These systemic effects create a more favorable environment for brain health, indirectly supporting cognitive function, whether or not PQQ itself crosses the BBB.
                </p>
                
                <h4>Supplementation</h4>
                <p>
                    Although many studies show benefits at 20 or 30 mg, 40 &ndash; 200 mg per day of PQQ is safe. It is fat-soluble and best taken with other fat-soluble supplements and food.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In 2017, the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) Panel on Dietetic Products determined a No Observed Adverse Effect Level (NOAEL) of 100mg/kg per day for 90 days. For a 50kg woman, this translates to a dose of 5g per day. Other studies have investigated PQQ's benefits and safety using similar dosages.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Given the vast multitude of benefits that occur on the cellular level and the incredibly high safety threshold, a recommended dose of PQQ is 40 &ndash; 200mg per day. There are no known contraindications.  Dose-dependent effects have been observed in rodents with <abbr title="Traumatic Brain Injury">TBI</abbr>. It is recommended to start with a more moderate dose of 40 mg per day and gradually increase. <cite class="reflink"><a href="#l-zhang">L. Zhang</a></cite>
                </p>
                
                <h4>Side Effects</h4>
                <p>
                    Mild headaches and insomnia may be experienced when PQQ is taken at night. Higher doses (e.g., 100-200 mg per day) are well-tolerated and may provide more pronounced effects.

                    Vitamin K2 supports mitochondrial function by activating sirtuin 1 (SIRT1), a longevity gene that regulates mitochondrial biogenesis and helps manage oxidative stress. However, K2's biggest role is its effects on bone metabolism and the bone-brain axis. <cite class="reflink"><a href="#d-simes">D. Simes</a></cite>

                <h4>Blood-Brain Barrier</h4>
                <p>
                    Vitamin K2's ability to cross the blood-brain barrier enables it to exert its effects within the central nervous system, including reduced oxidative stress in neurons and reduced neuroinflammation. <cite class="reflink"><a href="#a-popescu">A. Popescu</a></cite>

                <h4>Bone-Brain Axis</h4>
                <p>
                    Osteocalcin is a protein produced by cells in bones called osteoblasts. Vitamin K2 promotes osteoblastogenesis, the creation of new osteoblasts, which produce osteocalcin. Vitamin K2 also activates osteocalcin (OCN) by <dfn>carboxylating</dfn> it, which allows it to bind calcium to mineralize bones <cite class="reflink"><a href="#m-yamaguchi">M. Yamaguchi</a></cite>.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    Osteocalcin circulates as a peripheral hormone, crosses the BBB, and promotes spatial learning and memory while preventing anxiety-like behavior. This complex interplay between the bones and the CNS, influencing each other’s function and behavior, is known as the <dfn>bone-brain axis</dfn>. <cite class="reflink"><a href="#a-obri">A.

                <h5>Brain Calcification</h5>
                <p>
                    Calcium deposits in the basal ganglia can disrupt normal movement patterns, leading to symptoms such as dystonia, tremors, and unsteady gait. Vitamin K2 supplementation helps address these issues by increasing osteocalcin production and by activating Matrix Gla Protein (MGP), which drives osteoblastogenesis.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Vitamin K2 increases osteocalcin in both its forms, carboxylated and undercarboxylated (ucOCN). Carboxylated osteocalcin moves calcium from the bloodstream into bones, reducing calcification in tissues such as the brain and arteries, promoting neurological function and cerebral blood flow. Serum ucOCN circulates and acts on various tissues, including the brain, and is correlated with better cognitive function <cite class="reflink"><a href="#gu">gu</a></cite>. 
                </p>
                
                <h5>Matrix Gla Protein (MGP)</h5>
                <p>
                    <abbr title="Matrix Gla Protein">MGP</abbr> is a vitamin K-dependent protein synthesized in bone and various mesenchymal cells, including vascular smooth muscle cells and chondrocytes. Vitamin K2 activates MGP by carboxylating it, which can prevent calcification in blood vessels, kidneys, and the brain by helping to direct it to bones <cite class="reflink"><a href="#k-maresz">K. Maresz</a></cite>. These effects are dose-dependent and research has shown that typical microgram doses may not be effective at reducing arterial calcification. <cite class="reflink"><a href="#bjorklund">Bjørklund</a></cite>
                </p>
                
                <h5>High-Dose K2 Works</h5>
                <p>
                    A randomized, placebo-controlled multicenter study on elderly men with aortic valve calcification found no significant impact of 720 µg MK-7 plus vitamin D on calcification progression over two years. 720 µg is considered to be a high dose, but was still ineffective <cite class="reflink"><a href="#diederichsen">Diederichsen</a></cite>. Another study demonstrated that a 0.5 mg (500 µg) dose of Vitamin K2 significantly reduced undercarboxylated osteocalcin (%ucOC), and a 5 mg dose further enhanced this effect, showing dose-dependent effect, up to 5mg dose, for activation of Vitamin K-dependent proteins like osteocalcin and MGP for reducing calcification <cite class="reflink"><a href="#t-giri">Giri</a></cite>. 
                </p>
                
                <h5>Supplementation</h5>
                <p>
                    Vitamin K2 supplementation is generally safe and well-tolerated, as the body regulates it without toxic effects, even at doses as high as 45 mg per day in women with osteoporosis. Most available supplements, however, contain doses in the microgram range, which may be insufficient to provide the desired health benefits. <cite class="reflink"><a href="#t-giri">Giri</a></cite>

                <p>Humans naturally produce CoQ10, an antioxidant that exists in almost every cell of the body. Ubiquinol is the reduced form of CoQ10 and is absorbed more efficiently by the body than ubiquinone, the oxidized form of CoQ10.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    Ubiquinol is involved in energy production within the mitochondria. It improves mitochondrial function with exercise, improves cognitive function, and counteracts fatigue. <cite class="reflink"><a href="#s-fukuda">Sanae Fukuda</a></cite>
                </p>
                
                <h4>Mechanism of Action</h4>
                <p>
                    CoQ10 transports electrons in the electron transport chain (ETC) within the mitochondria, which is part of oxidative phosphorylation, to produce <abbr title="adenosine triphosphate">ATP</abbr> for cellular energy. <cite class="reflink"><a href="#m-spindler">M. Spindler</a></cite>
                </p>
                
                <h3>Ubiquinol in Parkinson's Disease</h3>
                <p>
                    In PD, ubiquinol may significantly reduce symptoms during "wearing off" periods (when levodopa's effects fade before the next dose), as reflected in total UPDRS scores, and is safe and well-tolerated. <cite class="reflink"><a href="#a-yoritaka">A. Yoritaka</a></cite>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Previous studies using ubiquinone did not show significant effect in PD patients. However, ubiquinol, the reduced form of CoQ10, has demonstrated efficacy.
                </p>
                   
                <p>
                    Mitochondrial dysfunction accelerates PD progression by increasing oxidative stress, reducing ATP production, and promoting the accumulation of toxic protein aggregates like alpha-synuclein. These aggregates form Lewy bodies, which contribute to further neurodegeneration. <cite class="reflink"><a href="#a-ebrahimi">A. Ebrahimi</a>, <a href="#c-andreani">C. Andreani</a></cite>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Managing mitochondrial dysfunction in PD involves several strategies, and high-dose CoQ10 supplementation, which supports mitochondrial function, is one approach. <cite class="reflink"><a href="#m-spindler">M. Spindler</a></cite>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Multiple system atrophy (MSA) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder with symptoms similar to PD, including autonomic failure. Decreased ubiquinone levels contribute to this progression. Studies suggest that CoQ10 supplementation may help reduce neuronal apoptosis in MSA patients. <cite class="reflink"><a href="#f-nakamoto">F. Nakamoto</a></cite>
                </p> 

                <h4>Supplementation</h4>
                <p>
                    Ubiquinol has been demonstrated to be superior to ubiquinone. Phytosome Q10 has been shown to provide even greater absorption, but research shows strong safety and efficacy of ubiquinol, making it a reliable option for CoQ10 supplementation. <cite class="reflink"><a href="#p-langsjoen">P. Langsjoen</a>, <a href="#d-mantle">D. Mantle</a>, <a href="#g-petrangolini">G. Petrangolini</a></cite>
                </p>
                <p>
                    In a study published in The Lancet, a patient with advanced Multiple System Atrophy (MSA) showed restored brain oxygen consumption after taking 1200 mg of oral ubiquinol. This finding suggests a potential benefit of high-dose ubiquinol supplementation in MSA patients supports mitochondrial function. <cite class="reflink"><a href="#j-mitsui">J. Mitsui</a></cite>

                Geranylgeraniol (GG) is naturally synthesized in the human body via the mevalonate (cholesterol) pathway and can also be extracted from annatto seeds. GG is a precursor of CoQ10, vitamin K2, cholesterol, testosterone, and protein synthesis and modification. GG production declines with age, which can reduce levels of CoQ10, vitamin K2, and testosterone. <cite class="reflink"><a href="#h-j-ho">Ho</a></cite> 
            </p>
            
            <p>
                GG suppresses inflammation by improving the gut microbiome and enhancing glucose response, benefiting both gut health and systemic inflammation. <cite class="reflink"><a href="#e-chung">Chung</a></cite> 
            </p>                     
            
            <h4>Mechanism of Action</h4>
            <p>
                GG converts mevalonic acid (MVA), the precursor for cholesterol, into CoQ10, vitamin K2, and sex hormones, which helps protect mitochondrial function.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                CoQ10 and cholesterol are synthesized endogenously in both the body and brain, but their levels decline due to aging and mitochondrial dysfunction, a major problem in PD. The brain contains around 20% of the body’s total cholesterol. GG supplementation may help counteract these deficits by providing the raw material for their synthesis, supporting mitochondrial and neuronal function.
            </p>
            <h5>Cholesterol Turnover</h5>
            <p>
                Cholesterol is essential for synaptogenesis. Studies suggest that higher cholesterol levels are associated with a lower risk of PD, while lower cholesterol may be a risk factor for PD. GG can increase cholesterol turnover in the brain, potentially supporting brain cholesterol levels and neurological function. <cite class="reflink"><a href="#huang">huang</a></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
                A 2006 rodent study demonstrated that GG restored hippocampal long-term potentiation (LTP) levels. The study found that GG, but not cholesterol, increased cholesterol turnover in the brain and activated the mevalonate pathway. The research indicated that continuous production of GG in specific neurons is necessary for <abbr title="long-term potentiation">LTP</abbr> and learning. <cite class="reflink"><a href="#kotti">Kotti</a></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
                Dopamine synthesis requires substantial cellular energy. CoQ10 is a vital energy substrate for brain mitochondria, aiding their function and dopamine production. GG is essential for CoQ10 production, thereby supporting neuronal energy metabolism. <cite class="reflink"><a href="#h-j-ho">Ho</a>, <a href="#b-tan">Tan</a></cite> 
            </p>

            <p>
                While some forms of supplemental CoQ10 may cross the BBB, this remains uncertain. However, GG supplementation supports the body's natural synthesis of CoQ10 and cholesterol, both of which decline with age and mitochondrial dysfunction. Therefore, GG supplementation may help maintain mitochondrial health, support brain energy production, and protect neurons in PD.
            </p>

            <h4>BBB Permeability</h4>
            <p>
                GG, with a molecular weight (MW) of 268.39 g/mol, is likely to cross the BBB, as molecules with an <abbr title="Molecular Weight">MW</abbr> under 400 Da often can. This may offer an advantage over CoQ10, which has a higher <abbr title="Molecular Weight">MW</abbr> of 731 Da and might not cross the BBB (<a href="http://www.chemspider.com/Chemical-Structure.17216048.html"
                >chemspider</a>). 
            </p>

            <h4>Supplementation</h4>
            <p>
                Supplementing geranyl geraniol at 150mg per day is safe, as the body has a natural regulatory mechanism to keep levels from exceeding a healthy range.

            <p>
                Docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) is an omega-3 fatty acid found in eggs, fish, krill, and algae, and produced in small amounts in humans. DHA is necessary for normal brain function, for cognition, memory, and attention.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                DHA reduces neuroinflammation by mitigating oxidative stress, helping to neutralize <abbr title="Reactive Oxygen Species">ROS</abbr>, and increasing the master antioxidant glutathione. <cite class="reflink"><a href="#h-j-lee">H.J. Lee</a></cite>
            </p>
            
            <h4>DHA in Parkinson's Disease</h4>
            <p>
                Daily DHA supplementation in rodent studies has been shown to protect against core PD symptoms like problems with balance, walking, and dopamine function in brain areas responsible for movement. <cite class="reflink"><a href="#n-m-chitre">N.M. Chitre</a></cite>
            </p>

            <p>
               A 2017 review found that higher doses of DHA were more effective than EPA in increasing the levels of nerve growth factors of <abbr title="Nerve Growth Factor">NGF</abbr> and <abbr title="Brain-derived Neurotrophic Factor">BDNF</abbr> in a dose-dependent response. <cite class="reflink"><a href="#y-p-zhang">Y.P. Zhang</a></cite> 
            </p>

            <p>
                A placebo-controlled trial in adults without cognitive impairments found that supplementing 2g of DHA daily for 6 months led to small increases in <abbr title="cerebrospinal fluid">CSF</abbr> DHA following supplementation, with APOE4 carriers having a lower increase than non-carriers. 
            </p>
            <p>
                The study explained that DHA crosses the BBB through passive diffusion, meaning that high blood levels are required to significantly raise DHA levels in the brain. A 200% increase in blood DHA resulted in only a 28% rise in <abbr title="Cerebrospinal Fluid">CSF</abbr>. <cite class="reflink"><a href="#i-c-arellanes">I.C. Arellanes</a></cite> 
            </p>
            
            <h4>Supplementation</h4>
            <p>
                 Based on the discussed research, DHA can be started at 2 grams per day, and increased gradually. Liquid DHA products may be more effective for those requiring higher doses, but should be kept refrigerated to prevent oxidation. Higher doses of DHA are generally well tolerated, but individual tolerance varies, so splitting doses across meals can help with absorption and reduce the risk of stomach upset.

            <h3>Cholinergics and Membrane Support</h3>
            
            <p>
                Cholinergics strengthen cell membranes, which can dampen calcium channel overactivation, thereby reducing excitatory states.
            </p>
            <p>
                Cholinergic supplementation has been shown to improve cognitive function, increase physical power output, provide neuroprotection, and improve conditions of neurological disorders. Restoring phosphatidylcholine (PC) to healthy levels has been shown to combat neurological decline and reduce DRT dependence and its associated side effects. <cite class="reflink"><a href="#m-zhou">M. Zhou</a>, <a href="#m-amalric">M. Amalric</a>, <a href="#b-s-baumel">B.S. Baumel</a></cite>
            </p>

            <p>
                Cholinergic supplements support neuronal health by maintaining cell membrane integrity, improving neurotransmitter synthesis, and providing neuroprotection. This helps sustain cognitive function and neuronal survival.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The cholinergic and dopaminergic systems are interdependent. Cholinergic supplements uridine monophosphate (UMP), CDP-Choline, alpha-GPC, and phosphatidylserine (PS) strengthen the cholinergic system and can help restore balance when DRT is used.
            </p>
            
            <h4>Cholinergic and Dopaminergic Interdependence</h4>
            <p>
                The cholinergic and dopaminergic systems interact and converge in various brain regions, including the basal ganglia and hippocampus, to regulate cognition, movement, and behavior. Disruption of these interactions contributes to various symptoms of PD, including dyskinesia. 
            </p>
            
            <h4>Interactions with DRT</h4>
            <p>
                Supplementation with CDP-choline, UMP, and alpha-GPC reduces the need for DRT and should be considered and monitored under medical supervision. However, the benefits of these supplements extend beyond merely reducing the required dose of DRT. <cite class="reflink"><a href="#r-eberhardt">R. Eberhardt</a></cite>
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Phosphatidylserine (PS) levels are often decreased in idiopathic PD and its supplementation may also alleviate dopamine replacement therapy (DRT) side effects. <cite class="reflink"><a href="#g-zhai">G. Zhai</a></cite>
            </p>


            <h4>Cholinergics Example Stack</h4>
            <p>
                An example cholinergic supplement stack might include UMP and CDP-choline at 250 mg each, twice daily, 500 mg alpha-GPC pre-workout, 200 mg PS after dinner, and 3000 mg DHA daily.
            </p>

            <h4>Phospholipids and Alpha-Synuclein</h4>
            <p>

                    Uridine is a type of nucleoside, a fundamental component of nucleic acids. Nucleic acids are the building blocks of life and are used for storage and transmission of genetic information.

                <h4>How it Works</h4>
                <p>
                    As explained under the section DHA &amp; Uridine, Uridine restores unilateral dopaminergic neurotransmission, transmission from the substantia nigra to the striatum, when that region is impacted by oxidopamine lesions in rodent models. Research shows the best results when uridine is taken with DHA and choline (more on this appears below). <cite class="reflink"><a href="#m-cansev">M. Cansev</a></cite>

                    UMP supplementation increases CDP-choline levels. As a precursor to brain phospholipids, it supports cell membrane integrity and cognitive functions such as memory and learning. <cite class="reflink"><a href="#n-agarwal">N. Agarwal</a></cite>

                    Phospholipids are phosphorus-containing compounds found in the brain involved in the regulation of various signaling pathways, including neurotransmission, synaptic plasticity, energy transfer, and nucleic acid structure.

                <p>
                    Phosphatidylcholine (PC), the most abundant phospholipid in the brain, requires three compounds: choline; a pyrimidine such as uridine; and a polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) such as DHA. <q>When all three of the nutrients are provided concurrently, the resulting increase in PC production is greater than the sum of the increases produced by giving each separately.</q> <cite class="reflink"><a href="#r-j-wurtman">R.J.

                    DHA has been shown to restore dopaminergic neurotransmission loss in PD models, with enhanced effects when combined with UMP. <cite class="reflink"><a href="#m-cansev">M. Cansev</a></cite>

                    In a 2006 study conducted by researchers from two universities, Brain <abbr title="Phosphatidylcholine">PC</abbr> rose by 13&ndash;22% with uridine and choline alone, or DHA alone, or by 45% with the combination. Oral administration of uridine or DHA alone was shown to increase synaptic proteins and phospholipids, and in combination, a synergistic effect was noticed. Later research confirmed the cognitive benefits of these effects. <cite class="reflink"><a href="#s-holguin">S. Holguin</a></cite>

                    CDP-Choline (cytidine diphosphate-choline, also "Citicoline") is an essential intermediate in the biosynthetic pathway of structural phospholipids, particularly <abbr title="Phosphatidylcholine">PC</abbr>, found in cell membranes through the body, especially the liver and brain. <cite class="reflink"><a href="#jj-secades">J.J. Secades</a></cite>

                <p>
                    CDP-Choline supports cognitive function, including memory, and offers neuroprotection, potentially slowing age-related cognitive decline and supporting brain health in neurodegenerative diseases. Clinical studies show its benefits for brain health in patients with mild cognitive impairment and other neurological conditions.
                </p>
                <p>
                    CDP-Choline increases brain choline uptake for PC and acetylcholine production, for neuronal membranes and myelin sheaths, membranes that wraps around nerves cells, providing insulation and facilitating the rapid transmission of electrical signals along nerve fibers. 
                </p>
                
                <p>                                     
                    CDP-Choline has several benefits over direct <abbr title="Phosphatidylcholine">PC</abbr> supplementation through its efficient metabolic conversion and broader physiological effects. CDP-Choline is digested into cytidine and choline, which are absorbed into the bloodstream and can then be reassembled into CDP-Choline within cells. Directly supplementing does not achieve the same level of metabolic conversion and physiological effects.  <cite class="reflink"><a href="#u-kansakar">U. Kansakar</a></cite>

                    CDP-Choline's many beneficial effects and supporting evidence are explained by the large role it plays in the body.

                <h4>CDP-Choline in PD</h4>
                <p>
                    CDP-Choline supplementation can effectively reduce the dosage and consequential side effects of <abbr title="Dopamine Replacement Therapy">DRT</abbr>. <cite class="reflink"><a href="#r-eberhardt">R. Eberhardt</a></cite>

                <p>
                    Glutamate excitotoxicity is a problem of cellular damage in PD and various other neurodegenerative diseases. This happens when neurons are damaged and killed by the excessive glutamate.  <cite class="reflink"><a href="#f-a-arnold">Arnold</a></cite>
                </p>
                
                <p>     
                    CDP-Choline reduces glutamate excitotoxicity and oxidative stress, increases neurotrophin levels, enhances neurotransmitter release (such as norepinephrine and dopamine), promotes mitochondrial function, and modulates insulin signaling. <cite class="reflink"><a href="#c-mir">C. Mir</a></cite>
                </p>

                    Neurotrophins BDNF and NT-3, a protein growth factor that belongs to the NGF (Nerve Growth Factor) family of neurotrophins, are reduced in PD. This is problematic, as neurotrophins increase neuronal survival and growth. Their depletion in PD likely contributes to progressive neurodegeneration (PN). CDP-choline increases neurotrophin activity and expression, which is neuroprotective and reported to have noticeable positive effects. <cite class="reflink"><a href="#k-a-jellinger">Jellinger</a>, <a href="#p-arenth">P.

                 A 2022 review found profound neurological and cognitive benefits from some choline-containing phospholipids (CCPLs), in particular alpha-GPC, and also CDP-choline. They attribute these results to improvement in ischemic conditions, increased synthesis of phospholipids and neurotransmitters, incorporation into the membrane phospholipid structure, and improved mitochondrial metabolism. <cite class="reflink"><a href="#p-roy">P.

                <h4>Ischemic Mitigation</h4>
                <p>
                     In patients with chronic cerebral ischemia, citicoline improves scores on cognitive rating scales. CDP-choline prevents ischemia-induced tissue accumulation of free fatty acids and reduces infarct volume (direct measurement of the extent of tissue death or necrosis caused by an ischemic stroke), and brain edema, thus resulting in an antiapoptotic effect that is related to the mitochondrial-dependent cell death mechanism. <cite class="reflink"><a href="#jj-secades">J.J. Secades</a></cite>
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    CDP-coline improves axonal transport deficits and supports axon regeneration. Axon regeneration is limited in adults, partly due to the reduced growth potential of mature neurons. <cite class="reflink"><a href="#f-oddone">F. Oddone</a>, <a href="#c-iulia">Iulia</a></cite>

                <h5>Uridine and CDP-Choline</h5>
                <p>
                    CDP-Choline aids in the synthesis of <abbr title="Phosphatidylcholine">PC</abbr> and serves as a precursor to choline and uridine in the brain. Uridine, a nucleotide base, can convert to back CDP-choline and vice versa through natural metabolic pathways. 
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    Supplementing with both uridine and CDP-Choline together can significantly benefit brain health and cognitive function, often allowing for lower doses of each. This combination enhances neuroprotection, memory, and learning by boosting acetylcholine production. These synergistic effects are increased with the addition of <abbr title="Docosahexanoic Acid">DHA</abbr>. <cite class="reflink"><a href="#b-s-baumel">B.S. Baumel</a></cite>
                </p>

                <p>
                    Both uridine and CDP-Choline are neuroprotective and independently contribute to the production of PC, which supports acetylcholine synthesis and enhances cell membrane integrity.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Because Uridine increases CDP-choline levels, it is necessary to balance their co-supplemention. Uridine is a precursor to CDP-choline, increasing uridine levels can potentially affect the balance of these two compounds in the body.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    Uridine and CDP-choline work together to support brain health and cognitive function. CDP-choline helps synthesize phosphatidylcholine (PC) and serves as a precursor to both choline and uridine in the brain. Uridine can convert to CDP-choline and supports RNA synthesis during cell growth and repair. These compounds improve memory, learning, acetylcholine production, and cell membrane stability while providing neuroprotection. UMP, a precursor to uridine, supports dopamine levels and contributes to CDP-choline synthesis, so maintaining balance in their supplementation is important for effective results. <cite class="reflink"><a href="#l-wang">L. Wang</a></cite>

                <h5>CDP-Choline Supplementation</h5>
                <p>
                    A typical dosage of 500 mg CDP-choline per day is safe for most, but tolerance and effects vary based on individual differences or other supplements and medications, requiring dosage adjustments. Excessive supplementation may lead to imbalances, particularly in advanced disease stages.
                </p>
                
                <h5>Anticholinergics ❌ CAUTION</h5>
                <p>
                    Contrary to the dying myth, acetylcholine does not cause the tremors of PD. The drugs <em>given</em> to reduce CDP-choline in PD, such as Trihexyphenidyl and Benztropine, impact neurological function, resulting in confusion, memory issues, hallucinations, dry mouth, blurry vision, and urinary retention problems — serious side effects.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                <em>Increasing</em> choline by 1,200 mg of supplemental citicoline improved tremors in PD and allowed patients to halve their L-dopa + decarboxylase inhibitor dose. Uridine increases CDP. It's important to have a healthcare provider that understands and accounts for this as part of a holistic plan.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    CDP-choline, uridine monophosphate (UMP), and alpha-GPC can augment the effects of DRT due to their neurotransmitter synthesis, particularly acetylcholine, which can interact with dopamine pathways. It is important to balance their supplementation DRT under medical supervision.

                    Alpha-GPC (L-alpha-glycerylphosphorylcholine) is a highly bioavailable, naturally occurring form of choline that is synthesized for dietary supplements.
                </p>
                
                <h4>Benefits</h4>
                <p>
                    Alpha-GPC increases the release of acetylcholine, promotes learning and memory, and counters cognitive impairment. It has been shown to decrease age-dependent structural alterations in the frontal cortex and hippocampus of rats' brains. <cite class="reflink"><a href="#f-amenta">F. Amenta</a></cite> 
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    A review study published in Fronteirs in Cell Neuroscience highlighted some of the amazing benefits of alpha-GPC, considering the most promising molecule for brain disorders characterized by vascular impairment, and called for larger attentively controlled studies. 
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    Citing a rodent model study, they highlighted how administration of α-GPC (400 mg/kg) for 7 days countered the increase of stress hormones, reduced hearing loss, and prevented neuronal injury in rats. These neuroprotective effects were due to the increase of choline acetyltransferase (ChAT), reduction of brain neuroinflammation, and enhanced BDNF expression in the hippocampus. 
                </P>
                
                <p>
                    The researchers cited other research showing that Alpha-GPC contributes to anabolic processes responsible for membrane phospholipid and glycerol-lipid synthesis, positively influencing membrane fluidity. <cite class="reflink"><a href="#p-roy-gpc">P. Roy</a></cite> 
                </p>
                
                <h4>Alpha-GPC and Exercise</h4>
                
                <p>
                    A double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over design study in 2015 found that 600 mg per day of alpha-GPC increased lower body force production after just 6 days, making a recommendation for speed and power athletes to enhance muscle performance. <cite class="reflink"><a href="#d-bellar">Bellar</a></cite> 
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    Another small, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover study found that alpha-GPC supplementation prevents exercise-induced reductions in choline levels, increases endurance performance, and increases growth hormone secretion. <cite class="reflink"><a href="#a-parker">Parker</a></cite> 
                </p>
                
                <h4>Osmolytic Effects</h4>
                <p>
                    While betaine may provide some general cellular stability that could indirectly aid in preventing misfolding
                </p>
                <h4>Side effects</h4>
                <p>
                    Alpha-GPC may increase the production of Trimethylamine-N-oxide (TMAO) in the gut, which may increase the risk of stroke. A review study published in 2021 found that alpha-GPC usage was associated with a 46% higher risk of stroke. <cite class="reflink"><a href="#g-lee">G. Lee</a></cite> 
                </p>
                                
                <h4>Supplementation</h4>
                <p>
                    Alpha-GPC's rapid uptake leads to sharp increases in acetylcholine, making it an excellent choice 60 min prior to training sessions of maximal power output, as part of a total cholinergic stack. A typical pre-workout dosage is 300 - 600 mg pre-workout.
                </p>

                <h4>Benefits</h4>
                <p>
                    Phosphatidylserine (PS) is an essential component of cellular membranes. It helps regulate membrane support, improves signal transduction, inhibits neuroinflammation, provides neuroprotection, and improves cognitive function.
                </p>
                
                <h4>Details and Mechanisms</h4>
                <p>
                    PS binds to various proteins and is involved in many biological processes, including enzyme activation, apoptosis, neurotransmission, and synaptic refinement. Dysregulation of these processes is common in various CNS diseases. <cite class="reflink"><a href="#x-ma">X. Ma</a></cite>
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    In a double-blind study, elderly patients with severe cognitive decline were treated with brain cortex-derived PS (BC-PS) 300 mg/day for 6 months, compared with placebos, BC-PS administration significantly improved the storage, learning, and retrieval abilities of memory in patients. <cite class="reflink"><a href="#x-ma">X. Ma</a></cite>
                </p>
                
                <h4>PS as a Self-emulsifying Drug Delivery System (SEDDS)</h4> 
                <p>
                    SEDDS (Self-Emulsifying Drug Delivery Systems) are formulations designed to improve the oral bioavailability of poorly water-soluble substances. While PS itself is not a SEDDS, taking it with such substances may enhance their absorption and bioavailability. This is because it is both. PS liposomes loaded with astragaloside IV and nestifin-1 were shown to facilitate their penetration of the blood-brain barrier and reduce the expression of α-synuclein, making liposomal PS an effective delivery tool for other substances. <cite class="reflink"><a href="#y-kuo">Y. Kuo</a></cite>
                </p>

                <h4>Supplementation — Brain-Derived PS (Choric PS)</h4>
                <p>
                     PS promotes relaxation and reduces cortisol, making it a good choice for a post-workout recovery and evening supplementation at about 100 mg - 400 mg once or twice daily. <cite class="reflink"><a href="#m-kingsley">M. Kingsley</a></cite>

            <p>
            	Magnesium L-Threonate is a highly bioavailable form of magnesium that, unlike most magnesium supplements, crosses the blood-brain barrier to strongly support brain health and cognitive function. 
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In a 2019 rodent study where magnesium L-Threonate was compared to magnesium sulfate, only the L-Threonate form crossed the blood-brain barrier, where it then inhibited oxidative stress, attenuated motor deficits, and slowed the progression of neurodegeneration. <cite class="reflink"><a href="#y-shen">Y. Shen</a></cite> 
            </p>
            
            <p>
                 A 2022 study from Nanjing Medical University found that Magtein® significantly improved memory and cognition in healthy Chinese adults, with greater benefits in older participants. <cite class="reflink"><a href="#c-zhang">C. Zhang</a></cite> 
            </p>

            <h4>Calcium Regulation</h4>
            <p>
                Magnesium acts as a calcium antagonist in cells, helping to control intracellular calcium levels and reduce excitotoxicity. Excessive mitochondrial calcium, a common problem in PD, damages mitochondria, reducing energy output and contributing to cell death, as dopaminergic neurons are highly sensitive to calcium fluctuations and vulnerable to the excitotoxic damage it causes. <cite class="reflink"><a href="#maier">Maier</a></cite> 
            </p>
            
            <h4>BBB Dysfunction</h4>
            <p>
            	Magnesium also protects the integrity and function of the <abbr title="blood–brain barrier">BBB</abbr>, necessary for homeostasis, to protect the CNS and maintain healthy neurological function. <cite class="reflink"><a href="#romeo">Romeo</a>, <a href="#daneman">Daneman</a></cite> 
            </p>
            
            <h4>Supplementation</h4>
            <p>
                Magnesium can promote relaxation and improve sleep quality. Therefore, it is recommended to take this supplement in the evening.

            <!--
            Vitamin D3, or cholecalciferol, is a fat-soluble vitamin essential for various bodily functions. It aids in calcium absorption, supporting bone health and helping prevent conditions like osteoporosis. Beyond its role in bone maintenance, Vitamin D3 influences immune function and mood. It is synthesized through sunlight exposure and can also be obtained from diet and supplements. Its potential benefits in neurological health, particularly in conditions like Parkinson's disease, are an area of ongoing research.
            -->

                Vitamin D3 stimulates the osteoblasts to produce osteocalcin (OCN). Vitamin K2 converts some of this osteocalcin into its active form, carboxylated OCN. The remaining undercarboxylated OCN (ucOCN) enters the bloodstream and acts as a hormone in various tissues, including the brain. <cite class="reflink"><a href="#c-shan">C. Shan</a></cite>

            <h4>D3 and Parkinson's Disease</h4>
            <p>
                The Parkinson’s Disease Research, Education, and Clinical Center at the Portland and Puget Sound Veteran Affairs (VA) Clinics conducted an add-on study to a longitudinal study on neuropsychiatric function in individuals with PD. Researchers found that higher plasma vitamin D levels were associated with improved cognition and mood in PD patients without dementia. <cite class="reflink"><a href="#a-peterson">A.

            <h4>Supplementation</h4>
            <p>
                More is not always better! Too much vitamin D3 can disturb calcium levels. Vitamin D3 levels can be optimized with regular bloodwork and refined supplementation accordingly. 4,000 IU per day is safe. D3 is stored in the body, so a missed dose can be compensated by doubling the intake the next day.

            <p>
                Vitamin B1, also known as thiamine, is an essential vitamin that helps the body turn food into energy by supporting <dfn title="process that converts glucose into usable energy">glycolysis</dfn>, a process necessary for nerve, muscle, and heart health. This is particularly important in PD, where energy production in cells is typically impaired. Deficiencies in thiamine can further disrupt glycolysis, exacerbating energy production issues.
            </p>
            
            <h4>Thiamine and Mitochondrial Function</h4>
            <p>
                Thiamine, in its active form (thiamine pyrophosphate, TPP), serves as a cofactor for several enzymes involved in energy production, from glycolysis to oxidative phosphorylation within the mitochondria. These processes are necessary for meeting the cellular energy demands of neurons, the heart, and other tissues, particularly in conditions like PD, where mitochondrial dysfunction is common.
            </p>
            
            <h4>High-dose Thiamin in PD</h4>
            <p>
                High-dose thiamine has repeatedly been shown to reverse motor and non-motor symptoms in PD. An observational open-label pilot study beginning June 2012, published in the Journal <cite>Alternative and Complementary Medicine</cite> injected patients with 100 mg of thiamine intramuscularly twice a week, without altering patients' existing therapies. Patients were re-evaluated after 1 month and then every 3 months during treatment. This high-dose thiamine was effective in reversing PD motor and non-motor symptoms. The clinical improvement was stable over time in all patients. <cite class="reflink"><a href="#a-constantini">a-constantini</a></cite>
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Researchers hypothesized that thiamine-dependent metabolic processes could cause selective neural damage typically affected by PD which provokes neurodegeneration, and that thiamine could counteract that process, having both restorative and neuroprotective action in PD. 
            </p>
            
            <h4>DJ-1 Genetic Mutations, Thiamine</h4>
            <p>
                Mutations in the DJ-1 gene, also known as PARK7, are confirmed in about 1-2% of early-onset PD cases, but this figure could be higher due to limited genetic screening. The <abbr title="Parkinsonism-Associated Deglycase 1 or Park7">DJ-1</abbr> gene is responsible for thiamine biosynthesis. Since DJ-1 mutations contribute to oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction, patients with these mutations might see greater benefits from therapies that support mitochondrial function, such as high-dose thiamine supplementation. However, this is more related to enhancing mitochondrial health and less about directly addressing DJ-1's function. Genetic testing for DJ-1 mutations may help predict thiamine's usefulness. <cite class="reflink"><a href="#k-luong">k-luong</a></cite>
            </p>
            
            <h4>BBB</h4>
            <p>
                Thiamine has poor bioavailability but can cross the BBB through passive diffusion when its levels in the blood are high.
            </p>
            
            <h4>Supplementation</h4>
            <p>
                High-dose thiamine therapy for PD is not widely recommended by mainstream medical organizations, and long-term safety and efficacy data in humans is lacking. However, some forum users on HealthUnlocked have reported significant benefits from high-dose oral supplementation, with doses up to 1,000 mg per day. Patients should consult with their healthcare providers before initiating high-dose thiamine therapy.

                Vitamin B6, also known as pyridoxine, is used for synthesis of neurotransmitters including dopamine and serotonin, glutamatergic system regulation, and nervous system balance and maintenance.
            </p>
            <p>
                Vitamin B6 is necessary for dopamine biosynthesis and may help reduce the side effects of dopaminergic treatments.
            </p>
            
            <h4>P-5-P (Pyridoxal 5-Phosphate)</h4>
            <p>
                P-5-P (Pyridoxal 5-Phosphate) is the active coenzyme form of vitamin B6, which bypasses the need for liver conversion. While most research focuses on B-6, p-5-p may offer advantages over it. 
            </p>
            
            <h4>Relevance to Parkinson's Disease</h4>
            <p>
                Supplementation of vitamin B-6, along with vitamin B-12 and folic acid, can reduce high homocysteine levels caused by levodopa metabolism, which may help in managing metabolic and clinical complications such as peripheral neuropathy and osteoporosis. <cite class="reflink"><a href="#keun">Keun</a></cite>
            </p>
            
            <h4>Supplementation</h4>
            <p>
                Balanced methylated B-complex formulations generally provide sufficient amounts, from 10 - 50 mg of B-6 or P-5-P. A few such products include <q>Pure Encapsulations B-Complex Plus</q> and <q>Integrative Therapeutics Active B-Complex</q>. Talk to your neurologist about reducing DRT and supplementing with B-6, B-12 and folic acid.

            <h4>Full-Spectrum Vitamin E</h4>
            <h5>Tocopherols</h5>
            <p>
                Most vitamin E supplements are only alpha-tocopherol, which has the effect of reducing the body's levels of gamma-tocopherol <cite class="reflink"><a href="#d-wolf">D. Wolf</a></cite>. This is bad because, compared to alpha-tocopherol, gamma-tocopherol and delta-tocopherol can scavenge a wider range of <abbr title="Reative Oxygen and Nitrogen Species">RONS</abbr>  <cite class="reflink"><a href="#c-sen">Sen</a></cite>.
            </p>
            
            <h5>Tocotrienols</h5>
            <p>
                Tocotrienols are neuroprotective, anti-cancer, anti-oxidative, and cholesterol-lowering in ways tocopherols aren't.  <cite class="reflink"><a href="#a-abraham">A. Abraham</a>, <a href="#m-clarke">M. Clarke</a>, <a href="#c-sen">Sen</a></cite>
            </p>
            
            <p> 
                Consuming the full spectrum of all eight natural forms of vitamin E avoids problems with unilateral α-tocopherol supplementation and provides maximum synergy and health benefits. <cite class="reflink"><a href="#c-sen">C. Sen</a></cite>
            </p>

            <h4>Neuroprotective Effects</h4>
            
            <p>
                Tocotrienols have been shown to improve learning impairment in elderly subjects. A 2018 double-blind study out of Japan showed that the combination of tocotrienols with astaxanthin improves the composite memory and verbal memory of Japanese adults who feel memory decline. Astaxanthin and vitamin E are anti-oxidative, but tocotrienols are more than that. <cite class="reflink"><a href="#t-sekikawa">T. Sekikawa</a></cite>
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Tocotrienols cross the BBB, exerting neuroprotective effects independent of their antioxidant activity by binding to the estrogen receptor, as shown in multiple studies. <cite class="reflink"><a href="#t-matsura">T. Matsura</a>, <a href="#r-naomi">R. Naomi</a></cite>
           </p>
           
           <p>
               Tocotrienols also reduce BBB permeability by modulating tight junction proteins and reducing oxidative and inflammatory damage to the BBB. This helps maintain its integrity, which is essential for protecting the brain. <cite class="reflink"><a href="n-kaneai">N. Kaneai</a></cite>
           </p>
           
           <p>
                Tocotrienols more effectively inhibit lipid peroxidation compared to tocopherols, due to better incorporation into cell membranes. This action protects mitochondria and reduces oxidative stress. Tocotrienols have been shown to induce apoptosis of cancer cells while protecting neuronal cells from glutamate- and peroxidative-induced death. <cite class="reflink"><a href="#b-aggarwal">B. Aggarwal</a> <a href="#r-c-chiste">R.C. Chiste</a></cite>
            </p>

            <p>
                A 2021 controlled rodent model study showed that α- and γ- tocotrienols improved motor function and neuronal uptake in hippocampal cells, with α-tocotrienol demonstrating superior neuroprotective effects and preventing further reduction of dopaminergic neurons. <cite class="reflink"><a href="#m-kumari">M. Kumari</a></cite>
            </p>
            
            <h4>Human Trial Underway</h4>
            <p>
                A large-scale human trial, <a title="Tocotrienols in Parkinson's Disease (PD): A Pilot, Randomised, Placebo-controlled Trial" href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT04491383" target="_blank"><q>Tocotrienols in Parkinson's Disease (PD): A Pilot, Randomised, Placebo-controlled Trial</q></a>, was opened on April 2021. This two-year study is designed to compare the effects of 400mg/day tocotrienols vs placebo on neuropsychological conditions using cognitive tests and bloodwork, to evaluate PD biomarkers and for safety monitoring. Tocotrienols are available over the counter, so participation in the trial is not required to use them.
            </p>
            
            <h4>Supplementation and Safety</h4>

            <p>
                Vitamin E is best taken with dietary fat and other fat-soluble supplements.
            </p>
            <p>
                Vitamin E can thin the blood. Individuals taking blood thinners, and those with a history of stroke or brain bleeding should be cautious when taking vitamin E supplements.
            </p>
            <p>
                Light to moderate supplementation consisting of a naturally-sourced, balanced blend of the four tocotrienols and four tocopherols provides benefits while avoiding these risks. Do not exceed the recommended dose. High doses of vitamin E, particularly the synthetic form dl-alpha-tocopherol, are unhelpful to neurodegenerative conditions and are toxic.
            </p>

            <h3>NAD+ and its precursors NMN, NR, and Niacin</h3>

            <h3>Nicotinamide Adenine Dinucleotide (NAD+)</h3>
            <p>
                NAD+ is a coenzyme necessary for mitochondrial health, energy metabolism, DNA repair, and cell signaling. Mitochondrial dysfunction, including reduced NAD+ levels, is a primary pathology of PD requiring thorough attention.
            </p>
            
			<p>
				NAD+ regulates sirtuins, a family of enzymatic proteins that protect cells under stress, reducing inflammatory processes throughout the body and brain, protecting neurons in neurodegenerative diseases like PD, AD, and MS. Mitochondrial sirtuins specifically protect neurons in various PD models. <cite class="reflink"><a href="#l-he">He</a></cite>
			</p>
			
            <p>
                 NAD+ reduces oxidative stress, promoting cellular recovery and improving energy metabolism, neuroprotection, and DNA repair by modulating mitochondrial function. It reduces inflammation through immune modulation, causing macrophages to lower pro-inflammatory cytokines and increase anti-inflammatory cytokines.
            </p>

            <p>
                NAD+ promotes mitophagy, which leads to mitogenesis. Mitophagy, the controlled breakdown of damaged mitochondria, results in new mitochondrial formation, enhancing neuronal survival and reducing reactive oxygen species (ROS). Lower ROS levels reduce oxidative stress and may help prevent α-synuclein misfolding and aggregation.
            </p>
            
            <h4>Declining NAD+ Levels</h4>
            <p>
                Declining NAD+ levels contribute to reduced mitochondrial function and impaired cellular energy metabolism in neurons. This increases neurons' susceptibility to oxidative damage and degeneration.
            </p>

            <p>
                Raising NAD levels (through injection, precursor supplementation, and upregulation via exercise) improves mitochondrial function and count in neuronal cells. This explains how it improves neurotransmission, synaptic plasticity, and motor symptoms.
            </p>
            
            <h4>How NAD+ Decline Impacts Brain Health in Aging and PD</h4>
            <p>
	            A 2019 study in Cell Metabolism found that NAD+ decline accelerates cellular aging and predisposes cells to neurodegenerative diseases. Sufficient NAD+ levels support normal autophagy/mitophagy, mitochondrial stress responses, proteasomal degradation (see <a href="#protein-clearance-pathway-dysfunction">Protein Clearance Pathway Dysfunction</a>), and mitochondrial biogenesis—all of which maintain cellular quality and function. Age-increased NAD+ utilization and depletion disrupt these regulatory processes, impairing mitochondrial homeostasis and neuronal function. <cite class="reflink"><a href="#lautrup">Lautrup</a></cite>
			</p>
			<p>
				Mitochondrial dysfunction leads to reduced ATP production and increased reactive oxygen species (ROS), which further damage mitochondria, further impacting its energy production mechanisms, including oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS), and the <abbr title="tricarboxylic acid cycle">TCA cycle</abbr>.  This leads to excessive calcium influx which damages mitochondrial membrane potential and damages neurons. Calcium dysregulation in PD worsens mitochondrial dysfunction, further reducing ATP and damaging neurons. (see: <a href="#mitochondrial-calcium-dysregulation">Mitochondrial Calcium Dysregulation</a>).
			</p>
			<p>
				NAD+ depletion compounds these mitochondrial issues, especially by disrupting mitophagy and promoting accumulation of damaged mitochondria. A 2019 study in Cell Metabolism found that NAD+ decline accelerates cellular aging and predisposes cells to neurodegenerative diseases.
			</p>
			<p>
				This research explains how age-associated declines in mitochondrial function accelerates susceptibility to diseases like PD, ALS, and AD, where impaired NAD+-dependent pathways, reduced mitophagy, and increased oxidative stress accelerate neurodegeneration. 
			</p>
            <h4>NAD Precursors</h4>
            <p>
                Supplementation with NAD precursors NMN, NR, and niacin, increases cellular levels of NAD+ (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide). Among these, NMN is considered the safest and most effective precursor for increasing NAD+ levels, due to its direct conversion pathway.
            </p>

            <p>
                Niacin increases NAD+ levels but through a different metabolic pathway, separate from the more direct conversion of NMN and NR.

                <p>
                    Oral administration of NMN was shown to increase NAD+ levels in rodent brains <cite class="reflink"><a href="#d-i-ingram">D. Ingram</a></cite> and extremely large doses (500 mg/kg) injected over 10 days were shown to cause sustained improvement in cognitive function in rodents, as assessed by the Morris water maze. <cite class="reflink"><a href="#xionan-wang">X.

            <p>
                Blueberries are rich in a variety of bioactive compounds that work together to offer health benefits. These compounds, when consumed from whole blueberries or their extracts, may be more effective than consuming individual components separately.
            </p>

            <h4>Pterostilbene — Blueberry's Powerful Polyphenol</h4>
            <p>
                Pterostilbene, a compound in blueberries, protects it against viral, bacterial, and fungal attack and excessive sunlight, similar to resveratrol, another stilbene produced by blueberries and also found in grapes. 
            </p>
            
            <h4>Mechanism of Action</h4>
            <p>
                Pterostilbene exerts its neuroprotective effects by crossing the blood brain barrier, reducing oxidative stress and inflammation, increasing BDNF and neuroplasticity, altering CNS neurotransmitter systems (GABAergic, glutamatergic, and cholinergic), and improving symptoms of anxiety and depression.
            </p>
    
            <p>
                Compared to resveratrol, pterostilbene has been shown to have four times the oral bioavailability, making it much more effective at low doses. <cite class="reflink"><a href="#mccormack">McCormack</a></cite>
            </p>
            
            <h4>Cognitive Effects</h4>
            <p>
                A double-blind <abbr title="randomized controlled trial">RCT</abbr> investigated the effects of dietary blueberry on cognition in adults aged 60-75 years, randomly assigned to receive either 24 g/day of freeze-dried blueberry powder (equivalent to 1 cup of fresh blueberries) or a placebo powder for 90 days, finding that freeze-dried blueberry powder improved verbal memory and executive function. <cite class="reflink"><a href="#miller">miller</a></cite>
            </p>
            
            <h4>Blueberry Juice Plus Exercise</h4>
            <p>
                Exercise combined with polyphenol consumption may impart neuroprotective benefits greater than either treatment alone. 
            </p>
            
            <p>
                A 2022 placebo-controlled rodent study on rats with amphetamine-induced rotational behavior assessed the effects of blueberry juice (BBJ) and exercise (EX) on four groups of rats, with controls for both exercise and blueberry juice (placebo). <abbr title="blueberry juice">BBJ</abbr> alone did not improve rotation in the rats, but <em>exercise</em> alone did, significantly decreasing the number of amphetamine-induced rotations by 42%. However, most impressively, exercise + <abbr title="blueberry juice">BBJ</abbr> improved upon rotational behavior by 80%. <cite class="reflink"><a href="#castro">Catro</a></cite>
            </p>
            
            <h4>Real Blueberry vs. Pterostilbene Intake</h4>
            <p>
                Blueberries contain very small amounts of pterostilbene—around 99 to 520 ng per gram, meaning vast quantities would need to be consumed approach an effective dosage. For context, a daily dose of 100-250 mg of pterostilbene would require about 300,000 to 1.25 million blueberries, totalling over 40,000 kCal per day — an impossible amount.
            </p>
            
            <h4>Whole Blueberry plus Extract Consumption Strategy</h4>
            <p>
                 Blueberries are packed with multiple bioactive compounds (e.g., anthocyanins, resveratrol, flavonoids) that provide synergistic health benefits. However, relying on whole blueberries or concentrated forms like FruitFast to achieve therapeutic pterostilbene levels is impractical for the purposes of targeting effects like cognitive protection or reducing oxidative stress.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Blueberry extract (e.g., FruitFast) provides a range of bioactive compounds but is low in pterostilbene. A pterostilbene supplement (50-100 mg/day), taken with fats, targets specific neuroprotective and antioxidant effects. Higher pterostilbene doses (>50 mg/day) have been associated with gastrointestinal discomfort and elevated LDL cholesterol, which may require individual testing and dose adjustments.
            </p>

            <h3>Senolytics</h3>
            <p>
                Senolytics are used to selectively induce the death of senescent cells. Senolytic means "senescent cell destruction".
            </p>

            <h4>Senolytics in Parkinson's Disease</h4>
            <p>
                Senolytics inhibit and help degrade &alpha;-synuclein aggregation.
            </p>
            <p>
                In PD, &alpha;-synuclein and especially its mutant forms damage mitochondria, causing a leak of sirtuins from the inner membrane of the mitochondria leading to mitochondrial failure and eventual cell failure.
            </p>
            <p>
                Aggregates of &alpha;-synuclein form Lewy bodies inside the cell and block T-cells from activating the lysosome of non-functioning "zombie" cells.

                <h4>Overview</h4>
                <p>
                    Urolithin-A is a naturally occurring compound produced by gut bacteria through the transformation of polyphenols, such as ellagitannins and ellagic acid, found in small amounts of some foods like wild berries (pomegranates, etc), walnuts, and tea. Urolithin-A supplementation stimulates mitophagy and mitochondrial function in several tissues.
                </p>
                
                <h4>Benefits</h4>
                <p>
                    Urolithin-A-induced mitophagy promotes mitogenesis. This promotes neuronal survival and function, making Urolithin-A strongly neuroprotective. <cite class="reflink"><a href="#p-andreux">P. Andreux</a></cite>
                </p>
                
                <h4>Mitophagy</h4>
                <p>
                    Mitophagy is a cellular process that recycles and removes damaged or unhealthy mitochondria, leading to their replacement with new, healthy mitochondria. 
                </p>
                
                <h5>Urolithin-A and the PINK1-Parkin Pathway</h5>
                
                <p>
                    The PINK1-Parkin pathway is necessary for the removal of damaged mitochondria. In some conditions, including PD, it is impacted. When PINK1 enters healthy mitochondria, the mitochondria remove it. However, when the mitochondria are damaged, PINK1 accumulates on the outer membrane. This signals the recruitment of Parkin to the outer membrane, which marks the damaged mitochondria for recognition by autophagosomes. The autophagosomes engulf the damaged mitochondria and transport them to the cell's lysosome for degradation. This process, known as <dfn>mitophagy</dfn>, signals the cell to initiate  <dfn>mitochondrial biogenesis</dfn>, restoring cellular energy and function.
                </p>
                
                <h4>Mitophagy in Parkinson's Disease</h4>
                <p>
                    In PD, there is an abnormally higher number of damaged mitochondria. These damaged mitochondria accumulate alpha-synuclein and contribute to the formation of Lewy bodies. Inducing mitophagy helps clear these harmful mitochondria and restore cellular energy production. This process protects against dopaminergic neurodegeneration.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    A 2021 study using a PD-induced rodent model found urolithin-A exerted neuroprotective effects by promoting mitochondrial biogenesis via SIRT1-PGC-1α signaling pathway and ameliorated both motor deficits and nigral-striatal dopaminergic neurotoxicity. <cite class="reflink"><a href="#jia-liu">J. Liu</a></cite>
                </p>

                <p>
                    A 2019 rodent study out of Guangzhou, China found Urolithin-A, in a mouse model of AD, significantly improved spatial learning and memory, protected neurons from death, reduced neuroinflammation, and triggered neurogenesis. <cite class="reflink"><a href="#z-gong">Z. Gong</a></cite>
                </p>
                <p>
                    A 2023 review study found Urolithin-A was neuroprotective, protected against brain injuries, improved mitophagy and overall mitochondrial functions of the nerve cells, inhibited monoamine oxidase, and reduced cognitive decline. <cite class="reflink"><a href="#o-wojciechowska">O.

                <h4>Exercise Performance</h4>
                <p>
                    A 2022 <abbr title="randomized controlled trial">RCT</abbr> found Urolithin-A improved muscle strength, exercise performance, and biomarkers of mitochondrial health in a randomized trial in middle-aged adults. <cite class="reflink"><a href="#a-singh">A. Singh</a></cite>
                </p>
                Mice were gavage-fed with vehicle or taurine (500 or 1000 mg per kg body weight) daily for 10–12 month and culled at the age of 24 months for terminal assays
                <p>
                    Another <abbr title="randomized controlled trial">RCT</abbr> in 2022 found Urolithin-A conferred a significant improvement in muscle endurance and reduced <abbr title="C-Reactive Protein">CRP</abbr>. <cite class="reflink"><a href="#s-liu">S. Liu</a></cite>
                </p>
                
                <h4>Supplementation</h4>
                
                <p>
                    1000mg per day of Urolithin-A is safe and well-tolerated in humans.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    Urolithin-A is fat-soluble and can cross the BBB. Taking with food or other fat-soluble vitamins may improve absorption. 
                </p>
                
                <h4>Food Sources</h4>
                    Pomegranates contain ellagitannins, convertible to urolithin A by gut bacteria in 30% to 50% of people. Optimistically, eating 1 pomegranate might yield a negligible 2 milligrams of Urolithin-A — <em>not enough</em>!             
                
                <h4>Side Effects</h4>
                <p>
                    Potential unknown side effects might include gastric upset or potential interactions with certain medications that also undergo hepatic metabolism.  Taking with food may help.

                    Quercetin is a fat-soluble flavonoid naturally found in many plant foods like fruits and vegetables, especially apples, onions, and capers.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                	Quercetin has demonstrated neuroprotection in Parkinson's and other neurodegenerative brain disorders such as Alzheimer's, Huntington's, <abbr title="multiple sclerosis">MS</abbr>, and <abbr title="amyotrophic lateral sclerosis">ALS</abbr>. <cite class="reflink"><a href="#islam">Islam</a></cite>

                <h4>Neurodegenerative Disease Effects</h4>                
				<p>
	                A 2023 review highlighted quercetin's cognitive benefits in preclinical studies. Mechanisms included decreased neuroinflammation and oxidative stress, improved mitochondrial function and neurotransmitter signaling, and enhanced neurogenesis via <abbr title="Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor">BDNF</abbr> and <abbr title="Nerve Growth Factor">NGF</abbr>, and gene expression markers like <abbr title="Cyclic AMP Response Element-Binding Protein">CREB</abbr> and <abbr title="early growth response 1">EGR-1</abbr>, all relevant to PD. <cite class="reflink"><a href="#chiang">Chiang</a>, <a href="#x-w-zhang">Zhang</a></cite>
				</p>
                		
                <h4>Effects on Alpha-Synuclein</h4>
                <p>
                    A 2023 editorial published in Current Neuropharmacology revealed multiple studies including a lab study where oral administration of quercetin reduced α-synuclein clumping—a hallmark of PD—and protected dopamine-producing neurons from oxidative damage. <cite class="reflink"><a href="#das">Das</a></cite>
                </p>
				
				<h5>Ischemic Stroke — BBB and Other Effects</h5>
				<p>
					A 2022 meta analysis and systematic review found that quercetin promotes neurogenesis and reduces BBB permeability—both relevant to PD due to its antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects. <cite class="reflink"><a href="#guo">guo</a></cite>
				</p>
				
				<!--
				In PD, Quercetin inhibits α-synuclein aggregation, protects mitochondria, and modulates various cell-signaling pathways to promote neuronal survival and function. 
				-->
            	
				<h4>Calcium-Regulating Effects</h4>
				<p>
            		Quercetin has been found to inhibit calcium release from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) in response to <abbr title="endoplasmic reticulum">ER</abbr> stress, and may help maintain calcium homeostasis by reducing excessive calcium release. <cite class="reflink"><a href="#el-horany">El-Horany</a></cite>
            	</p>

                <!-- TODO
            	<p>
					It has been shown to modulate calcium channels, including voltage-gated calcium channels (VGCCs) and store-operated calcium channels (SOCCs). This modulation may help regulate calcium influx and efflux, contributing to overall calcium homeostasis.
				</p>
				-->
				<p>
					A highly-cited 2020 review found quercetin improves bone mineralization by stimulating the vitamin D receptor. This implies an uptake of calcium into bone, resulting in less extracellular calcium, which means less potential for excess intracellular calcium. This offers a potential benefit, given the known problems of <a href="#calcium-dysregulation">calcium dysregulation</a> and excess intracellular calcium in PD. The dose used in most of the reviewed rodent studies was 50mg/kg BW. For humans, that would roughly equate to 4mg/kg/day, so a 70kg human would need about 500mg per day. <cite class="reflink"><a href="#s-wong">Wong</a></cite>
				</p>
	                
                <h4>Quercetin vs Isoquercetin</h4>
            	<p>
            		Isoquercetin, with up to 40x higher absorption, offers greater therapeutic potential, making it a preferred option for supplementation. <cite class="reflink"><a href="#islam">Islam</a></cite>
            	</p>
                <h4>Supplementation</h4>
                <p>
                	A daily dose of 30 mg Isoquercetin or 1000 mg quercetin, taken with food, is well-tolerated and supports calcium regulation and neuroprotection.

                	Sulforaphane is a naturally occurring organosulfur compound found in cruciferous vegetables, especially broccoli sprouts. It has been shown to increase glutathione, the master antioxidant, in humans. It improves neurogenic pathways, activating anti-inflammatory microglia, leading to increased <abbr title="Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor">BDNF</abbr>. It has been shown to improve cognitive function in <abbr title="Traumatic Brain Injury">TBI</abbr> animal models, and its effects on PD are currently being studied in a phase II clinical trial, <a href="https://connect.careboxhealth.com/en-US/trial/listing/492695" target="_blank">A 6-month Study to Evaluate Sulforaphane Effects in PD Patients</a>. <cite class="reflink"><a href="#sedlak">Sedlak</a></cite>
