I have one page of HTML5 clean, valid markup that I made my self, by hand.

I want to make it into a four page website, parkinsons-supplements.com with navigation links, header, footer, and clean simple design theme.

| About Parkinson's Disease | Supplements | Therapies | Drugs |

I want clean, valid, static HTML and css, responsive to mobile devices. Please take a look at the attached code. I don't want invalid html or tag soup. 

Thank you.
