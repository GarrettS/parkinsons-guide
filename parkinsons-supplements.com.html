	<h1>
		Parkinson&rsquo;s Overview
	</h1>
	<p>
		Parkinson&rsquo;s Disease (PD) is a neurological condition resulting from pathology of alpha-synuclein (&alpha;syn) (&alpha;synopathy). 
	</p>

	<h2>Alpha-sinuclein</h2>
	<p>
		Overexpression of &alpha;syn leads to its aggregation and formation &alpha;syn structures, either as oligomers (peptides) or fibrils (see image). Oligomers of &alpha;syn can form lewy bodies, abnormal aggregations of protein that develop inside nerve cells affected by PD.
	</p>
	<p>
		<img src="img/alpha-synuclein.jpeg" alt="alpha synuclein"
		class="block-image">
	</p>

	<p>
		Alpha-synuclein is abundant primarily in the brain, especially in the neocortex, hippocampus, substantia nigra (SN). Smaller amounts are found in the heart, muscles, and other tissues. It is transported into and out of the brain by the blood-brain barrier.
	</p>

	<p>
		Six mutations of &alpha;syn are currently associated with familial parkinsonism. Mutant &alpha;syn forms aggregates more readily than wild-type (normal) &alpha;syn.
	</p>
	<p>
		Wild-type &alpha;syn can be removed by lysosomes, mutant forms of &alpha;syn, however, resist their own degradation and inhibit that of other substrates. 
	</p>

	<p>
		&alpha;syn oligomers play a central role in the multi-factorial causes of Parkinson&rsquo;s disease. &alpha;syn oligomers, as well as other &alpha;syn variants, actively participate in disrupting mitochondrial function, autophagy and lysosomal degradation, membrane 
		homeostasis, ER function and synapses, and can induce inflammation. 
	</p>

	<h3>SNCA Gene Encodes Alpha-synuclein</h3>

	<p>
		The SNCA gene encodes &alpha;syn. In the brain, &alpha;syn is found mainly at the tips of nerve cells (neurons) in specialized structures called presynaptic terminals.
	</p>
	<p>Mutations in the SNCA gene lead to mutant &alpha;syn.
	</p>

	<h3>
		Autosomal Dominant Parkinson's Disease, PARK1
	</h3>
	<p>
		PARK1 is an inherited, dominant genetic trait (autosomal dominant) in PD that causes heterozygous triplication of the SNCA gene.
	</p>

	<h3>LRRK2</h3>
	<p>
		Leucine-Rich Repeat Kinase 2 (LRRK2) is an enzyme encoded by a gene of the same name (the LRRK2 gene).
	</p>
	<h4>LRRK2-G2019S</h4>
	<p>
		LRRK2-G2019S is a mutant form of LRRK2 found in PD. LRRK2-G20195 cause αsyn accumulation in dopaminergic neurons. αsyn accumulation leads to all of the problems caused previously mentioned, including αsyn oligomers and fibrils.

	<p>
		LRRK2 mutants in genetic PD cause shortening and simplification of the dendritic tree in vivo and in cultured neurons.
	</p>
	<p>
	 LRRK2 inhibitors can improve Parkinson's disease by reducing α-synuclein.
	</p>

	<h3>PINK1</h3>
	<p>
		PTEN-induced kinase 1 (PINK1) is a kinase produced by the PINK1 gene.
		Mutations in the PINK1 gene are a rare cause of one form of autosomal recessive early-onset Parkinson's disease that may be more associated with mitophagy.
	</p>

	<p>
		The complex pathology is partially depicted in the figure below
	</p>

			<p>
			The pathological hallmarks of PD and the interplay of aging, environmental hazards, And genetics in thepathogenesis of PD. 
			</p>

			<p>
				(A) The pathological hallmarks of Parkinson’s disease include dopaminergic neuronal death, α-synuclein aggregates, mitochondrial dysfunction, reactive oxygen species, apoptosis, and neuroinﬂammation. 
			</p>
			<p>
				(B) PD is a multifactorial disorder involving aging, genetics, and environmental factors, associated with dopaminergic neuronaldeath. Gene mutations associate with PD includes DJ-1, PTEN-induced putative kinase-1 (PINK1), parkin, leucine-rich repeatserine/threonine kinase-2 (LRRK2), Synuclein alpha (SNAC), and ubiquitin carboxyl-terminal hydrolase-L1 (UCHL1). Neurotoxins (e.g., rotenone, paraquat) and gene mutations of DJ-1, PINK1, parkin, LRRK2, and SNAC induce mitochondria complex I inhibition, ATP depletion, reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation, mitochondria depolarization, and mitochondrialdysfunction in dopaminergic neurons to promote neuronal death in the substantia nigra of PD patients. 
			</p>

			<p>
				Overexpression of SNAC gene mutations enhance α-synuclein aggregation in Lewy bodies of PD brain. UCHL1 gene mutations impair ubiquitin-proteasome systems and further induce autophagy lysosomal pathway dysfunction, contributing to Lewy body formation in dopaminergic neurons.
			</p>
		</figcaption>
	</figure>
	<p>
		The diagram offers some visual depiction of PD, with small mistakes.
	</p>
	<p>
		The authors miscall the αsyn gene, SNCA, "SNAC". Most of what they categorize as genetic is actually epigenetic. That is, attributable to a combination genetic <em>and</em> environmental factors.
	</p>
	<p>
		Lewy bodies are comprised of αsyn fibrils, the manifestation of which can be partly affected by environmental factors. Lewy bodies appear in the “Genetic factors" group below αsyn. 
	</p>
	<p>
		αsyn increase is not solely attributable to genetics but to a variety of epigenetic factors that can be affected. 
	</p>
	<p>
		Epigenetic factors can influence mutations in LRRK2 (LRRK2-G2019S) and cause encoding mutations in LRRK2 and SNCA genes that affect production and pathogenicity of mutant αsyn.
	</p>
	<p>
		Vitamin B12, for example, is an external factor that prevents LRRK2-G2019S-potentiated α-synuclein accumulation in dopaminergic neurons.

	<p>
		Pesticide and herbicide exposure causes &alpha;syn overexpression in certain individuals. Rotenone, a pesticide, so reliably induces PD that it is used in studies to induce PD in rodents who can then be studied and treated experimentally.
	</p>

	<p>
		SATB1 a cell regulator, represses expression of the pro-senescence factor p21 in dopaminergic neurons. 

	</p>
	<p>
		 SATB1 is inhibited in Parkinson's disease. Less SATB1 means more p21 pro-senescence. Senescent dopaminergic neurons contribute to the pathology of Parkinson's disease.
	</p>
	<p>
		Senescent &ldquo;zombie&rdquo; cells cease to function and divide and damage healthy neighboring cells by propagating inflammation and senescence. 
	</p>
	<h4>Testing</h4>
	<p>
		Testing for alpha-sincuclein requires a spinal tap and also by saliva.
	</p>
	<p>
		Salivary αsyn was tested. Total αsyn was lower, but α-syn oligomers were higher in PD than in healthy subjects. (See: <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30796010/">Salivary alpha-synuclein in the diagnosis of Parkinson's disease and Progressive Supranuclear Palsy</a>)
	</p>
	<p>
		Genetic testing can help identify the type of PD. all genes associated with PD contribute to disease in the same way. LRRK2 and GBA genes can be tested on 23andme.
	</p>

	<h4>
		Treatment
	</h4>

	<p>
		Effective treatment must the PD from multiple angles. This requires understanding its pathology. The review <cite>"Current Therapies in Clinical Trials of Parkinson’s Disease: A 2021 Update"</cite>, provides a fair overview of PD.
	</p>

	<p>
		Supplements, peptides, therapies, drugs, and stem cells can mitigate asyn overexpression, reduce mutant asyn, strengthen the mitochondria, reduce the side effects of LD/dopa decarb, decrease the need for LD/dopa decarb, reduce ROS, improve mood, improve sleep, improve recovery. 
	<p>
		Strengthening mitochondrial function and count in neuronal cells prevents loss of SIRT3 and preserves their function.
	</p>
	<p>
		Peptide therapy, by practitioner in-home visits, can be used (SS-31, AICAR, Epitalon, Pinealon).
	</p>
	<p>
		Stem cell therapy may provide more dopaminergic neurons (dvcstem, Anova).
	</p>
	<p>
		Senolytics, drugs to induce death of senescent cells, may be used by a practitioner. 
	</p>
	<p>
		Estrogen is neuroprotective, so estrogen can be used in women.
	</p>
	<p>
		Testosterone is neuroprotective and converts partially to estradiol, so can be used in men.

			<h4>
				How Curcumin Helps PD
			</h4>
			<p>
				Curcumin prevents aggregation of alpha-sinuclein. It is anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective in neurological disorders. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Several studies in different experimental models of PD strongly support the clinical application of curcumin in PD. Curcumin crosses the blood-brain barrier
			</p>
			<p>
				Curcumin can be taken in pill form but absorbs best with food. Turmeric can be mixed into a cooked SEDDS (self-emulsifying drug delivery system) containing vegetables and coconut oil called &ldquo;curry&rdquo; and eaten and enjoyed.

			ALCAR protects dopaminergic neurons by abrogating neuroinflammation, apoptosis, astrogliosis, and oxidative stress. For PD, ALCAR protects cells against accumulation of alpha-synuclein.

			<strong>
				How r-ALA Works
			</strong>
		</p>
		<p>
			r-ALA decreases the levels of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) and iron. Iron has been shown to reduce survival rate, to induce injury to dopaminergic neurons, and to induce more severe motor deficits with mutant &alpha;syn.

			PQQ Pyrroloquinoline quinone
		</h3>
		<p>
			Pyrroloquinoline quinone (PQQ) is a naturally occurring coenzyme manufactured by bacteria, found in plants, and utilized by mammalian cells as an important nutritional growth factor. PQQ is not manufactured in humans.
		</p>
		<p>
			PQQ prevents fibril formation of &alpha;syn, strengthens mitochondria, boosts mitochondrial biogenesis in brain cells, improves cognitive deficit caused by oxidative damage, inhibits senescence, has nootropic effects of memory, attention, cognition, and learning, increases blood flow to the cerebral cortex, and prevents damage to cells caused by pesticides, and prevents neurodegeneration caused by oxidative stress, reduces LDL cholesterol inhibits osteoporosis.
		</p>
		<h4>
			Dosage:
		</h4>
		<p>
			 100-150mg per day. PQQ is very safe. In 2017, The EFSA Panel on Dietetic Products determined a no‐observed‐adverse‐effect‐
			<wbr />
			level (NOAEL) of 100 mg/kg bw per day, for a 90 day repeated oral dose toxicity study with BioPQQ&trade;. At 100 mg/kg bw, a 50kg woman would be expected to observe no side effects up to 5 grams per day of PQQ. 
		</p>
		<p>
			Given the vast multitude of benefits that occur on the cellular level, and especially by reducing alpha-synuclein fibrils relevant to PD sufferers, and the incredibly high safety threshold, a recommended dose of PQQ is 100-200mg per day. There are no known contraindications.

			DHA 
		</h3>
		<p>
			DHA (docosahexaenoic acid) is neuroprotective and prevents ROS production in dopaminergic neurons via enhancement of glutathione homeostasis. With DHA, higher doses are not only safe, they are more effective in lipid oxidation. 2000mg DHA per day is effective and safe, and, in DHA/EPA combinations, DHA in greater proportion to EPA is more effective.
		</p>
		<p>
			In PD, Unilateral oxidopamine lesions of the nigrostriatal pathway produce side-biased motor impairments that reflect motor deficits.
		</p>
		<p>
			<strong>
				DHA Dosage:
			</strong>
			 2 &ndash; 6g/day.
		</p>
		<p>
			DHA exhibits a dose-dependent response. Gastric tolerance between individuals vary. Start at 2 grams and work upwards from there. Spread consumption over a period of time.
		</p>
		<p>
			<strong>
				DHA + Uridine
			</strong>
		</p>
		<p>
			DHA has been shown to restore unlinateral dopaminergic neurotransmission loss in this model of Parkinson's disease, and the effect was augmented when combined with Uridine (uridine-5&rsquo;-monophosphate). 
		</p>
		<p>
			In a 2006 dual university study, Brain phosphatidylcholine rose by 13&ndash;22% with uridine and choline alone, or DHA alone, or by 45% with the combination. Oral administration of uridine or DHA alone was shown to increases synaptic proteins and phospholipids, and in combination, a synergistic effect was noticed.

			Uridine (uridine-5&rsquo;-monophosphate)
		</h3>
		<p>
			Uridine is a nucleosides which make up nucleic acids.
		</p>
		<h4>How it Works</h4>
		<p>
			Uridine increases CDP choline. As explained under the section DHA &amp; Uridine, Uridine restores unlinateral dopaminergic neurotransmission caused by oxidopamine lesions.
		</p>
		<p>
			<strong>❌ FAKE NEWS ALERT!</strong>
		</p>
		<p>
			Contrary to dying myth, acetylcholine does not cause the tremors of PD. The drugs given to reduce CDP choline in PD, such as Trihexyphenidyl and Benztropine, not only don&rsquo;t help PD, they have serious side effects! They cause confusion, memory issues, hallucinations, dry mouth, blurry vision, and urinary retention problems. 
		</p>
		<p>
			<em>Increasing</em> choline by 1,200 mg of supplemental citicoline improved tremors in PD and allowed patients halve their L-dopa + dopa decarboxylase inhibitor dose. Uridine increases CDP.

			Citicoline (CDP Choline):
		</h3>
		<p>
			As mentioned in the uridine discussion, citicoline supplementation halves L-Dopa / dopa decarb dosage. Citicoline is neuroprotective.
		</p>
		<p>
			In patients with chronic cerebral ischemia, citicoline improves scores in cognitive rating scales, while in patients with senile dementia of the Alzheimer type it stops the course of disease, and neuroendocrine, neuroimmunomodulatory, and neurophysiological benefits have been reported. Citicoline has also been shown to be effective in Parkinson disease, drug addictions, and alcoholism, as well as in amblyopia and glaucoma. No serious side effects have occurred in any series of patients treated with citicoline, which attests to the safety of treatment with citicoline.
		</p>
		<p>
			Citicoline reduces glutamate excitotoxicity and oxidative stress, increases neurotrophin levels, enhances neurotransmitter release (such as norepinephrine and dopamine), promotes mitochondrial function, and modulating insulin signaling. In addition, citicoline prevents ischemia-induced tissue accumulation of free fatty acids and reduces infarct volume and brain edema, thus resulting in an antiapoptotic effect that is related to mitochondrial dependent cell death mechanism
		</p>
		<p>
			Citicoline improves axonal transport deficits and supporting axon regeneration. Axon regeneration is limited in adults due partly to reduced growth potential of mature neurons.
		</p>
		<p>
		Because Uridine increases CDP levels, it is necessary to strike a balance between supplemental Uridine and CDP.

		<h3>Senolytics</h3>

		<p>
			Senolytics are small molecules that selectively induce the dissolution (lysis) of senescent cells. Senolytic means "senescent cell destruction".  
		</p>
		<p>
			In PD, &alpha;syn and especially its mutant forms damage mitochondria, causing a leak of sirtuins from the inner membrane of the mitochondria leading to mitochondrial failure and eventual cell failure. 
		</p>
		<p>
			Aggregates of &alpha;syn form Lewy bodies inside the cell and block T-cells from activating the lysosome of non-functioning "zombie" cells.  
		</p>

		<p>
			Senolytics help prevent the formation of &alpha;syn aggregates. This has two benefits. 
		</p>
		<p>
			First, it leads to a reduction in formation of Lewy bodies
		 (which are comprised primarily of fibrils of mutant &alpha;syn). 
			Commonly used senolytics include quercetin, trans-resveratrol, and fisetin.
		</p>
		<p>
			Second, it allows T-cell activation of the lysosome of senescent cells.
